ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Pfizer Inc. (the COMPANY, which may be referred to as WE, US, or OUR) is a
research-based, global pharmaceutical company. We discover, develop, manufacture
and market innovative medicines for humans and animals.

     Our home page on the Internet is at www.pfizer.com. You can learn about us
by visiting that site.

     NOTE THAT THROUGHOUT THIS 1999 10-K REPORT, WE "INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE"
CERTAIN INFORMATION IN PARTS OF OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). THE SEC ALLOWS US TO DISCLOSE IMPORTANT INFORMATION
BY REFERRING TO IT IN THAT MANNER. PLEASE REFER TO SUCH INFORMATION.

RECENT DEVELOPMENT

     On February 7, 2000, we announced an agreement to merge with Warner-Lambert
Company (Warner-Lambert). Under the terms of the merger agreement, which has
been approved by the Board of Directors of both Pfizer and Warner-Lambert, we
will exchange 2.75 shares of Pfizer voting common stock for each outstanding
share of Warner-Lambert voting common stock in a tax-free transaction valued at
$98.31 per Warner-Lambert share, or an equity value of $90 billion based on the
closing price of our stock on February 4, 2000 of $35.75 per share. Customary
and usual provisions will be made for outstanding options and warrants.

     The combined company, which will be called Pfizer Inc., is expected to have
(excluding any impact of anticipated restructuring charges and transaction fees
of $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion):

   o compounded annual revenue growth of 13% and earnings growth of 25% through
     2002

   o $4.7 billion in annual research and development expenses in 2000

   o anticipated annual cost savings and efficiencies totaling $1.6 billion by
     2002 ($200 million of these savings are expected to be achieved in 2000, $1
     billion in 2001 and $1.6 billion in 2002)

   o diluted earnings per share of $.98 on a pro forma basis in 2000, $1.27 for
     2001 and $1.56 for 2002 (these numbers include the $1.6 billion of cost
     savings phased in over this time period, but do not include any increased
     sales from collaborative activities and the $1.8 billion termination fee
     paid by Warner-Lambert to American Home Products Corporation).

     This transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the use of
pooling-of-interests accounting, qualifying as a tax-free reorganization,
shareholder approval at both companies and usual regulatory approvals. The
transaction is expected to close in mid-2000.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

     We operate in two business segments:

   o PHARMACEUTICAL, which includes prescription pharmaceuticals for treating
     cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, central nervous system
     disorders, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, allergies, arthritis and other
     disorders, as well as non-prescription self-medications, and;

   o ANIMAL   HEALTH,   which   includes   antiparasitic,   anti-infective   and
     anti-inflammatory  medicines,  and  vaccines  for  livestock,  poultry  and
     companion  animals.

     These businesses derive synergies in certain research and regulatory
matters, but each requires different marketing and distribution strategies and
sales organizations. Comparative segment revenues, profits and related financial
information for 1999, 1998 and 1997 are given in the table entitled SEGMENT
INFORMATION on page 60 of our 1999 Annual report. A table captioned PERCENTAGE
CHANGE IN TOTAL REVENUES
<PAGE>

and a graph captioned TOTAL REVENUES BY BUSINESS SEGMENT on page 29 of our 1999
Annual Report give segment information over the past three years. The
information from those sections of our Annual Report is considered to be
incorporated in this 1999 10-K report.

     Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries where we
operate. in the U.S., the main regulatory authority we deal with is the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of the
products we offer, our research quality, our manufacturing processes and our
promotion and advertising. Similar Government authorities act in most other
countries, and in many cases also regulate our prices. See GOVERNMENT REGULATION
AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS, below.

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT

     Our Pharmaceutical segment is comprised of the Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Group
and the Consumer Health Care Group.

PFIZER PHARMACEUTICALS GROUP

     Most of our pharmaceutical sales come from products in three major
therapeutic classes: cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases and central
nervous system disorders. We also have products for treatment of diabetes,
erectile dysfunction and allergies, as well as a co-promoted product for
arthritis. In 1999, prescription pharmaceuticals contributed 88% of our
revenues, as compared to 86% in 1998 and 83% in 1997. In 1999, we had seven
products, including alliance products, with sales to third parties in excess of
$1 billion each. Sales of our major in-line pharmaceutical products - NORVASC,
CARDURA, ZITHROMAX, DIFLUCAN, ZOLOFT, VIAGRA AND ZYRTEC - comprised 60% of our
revenues. A table captioned NET SALES - MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS on page 29
of our 1999 Annual Report is incorporated by reference.

     Cardiovascular disease products that treat problems affecting the heart and
the blood circulatory system are our largest therapeutic product line. NORVASC,
our largest-selling product, is a once-a-day medication for hypertension (high
blood pressure) and angina (heart pain). It is the largest-selling high blood
pressure medicine in the world. Our other cardiovascular products include
PROCARDIA XL, also a once-a-day product for hypertension and angina, and
CARDURA, which is used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia
(enlarged prostate gland). Sales of PROCARDIA XL continued to decrease during
1999, due, at least in part, to the medical community's increasing emphasis on
NORVASC.

     Also included in our cardiovascular disease product line is our alliance
product, LIPITOR, for treatment of high LIPIDS (cholesterol and, triglycerides)
in the bloodstream. We participated in the 1997 launch of LIPITOR under
co-promotion and licensing arrangements with the Parke-Davis Division of
Warner-Lambert Company, which discovered and developed the drug. Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert are continuing a broad clinical program for LIPITOR, as well as
planning the development of a single product that contains the cholesterol and
high blood pressure lowering medications in LIPITOR and NORVASC, respectively.

     We will add to our cardiovascular product line with the first-quarter 2000
launch of Tikosyn. This product is used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation
(rapid and irregular heartbeats in the atria or upper chambers of the heart).

     In the infectious disease medicine category, our major products are
ZITHROMAX and DIFLUCAN. ZITHROMAX is an oral or injectable antibiotic. During
1999, ZITHROMAX continued to be the most prescribed brand-name oral antibiotic
in the U.S. sales of ZITHROMAX increased in 1999 due to the increasing
recognition by physicians of the product's effectiveness in treating a broad
array of infections. DIFLUCAN is used to treat various fungal infections,
including vaginal infections and certain infections that afflict AIDS and cancer
patients with weakened immune systems.

     In June 1999, the European Union's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal
Products suspended the European Union ("EU") licenses of the oral and
intravenous formulations of our

                                       2
<PAGE>

antibiotic TROVAN for 12 months. In the rest of the world, including the U.S.,
the use of TROVAN is limited to serious infections in institutionalized patients
(see Item 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, below).

     For treatment of central nervous system disorders, we offer ZOLOFT and
co-promote ARICEPT. ZOLOFT is used for treatment of depression,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.
In 1999, Zoloft became the second Pfizer-developed product to achieve $2 billion
in annual sales. We participated in the 1997 launch of ARICEPT for treatment of
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. ARICEPT substantially expanded the prior
market for pharmaceutical treatment of that disease. The drug was discovered and
developed by Eisai Co., Ltd. which contracted with us to license and co-promote
the product in the U.S. and several other countries.

     In October 1999, we received an approvable letter from the FDA for RELPAX,
for the treatment of migraine. Regulatory review is continuing in Europe.

     In 1998, we introduced VIAGRA, our oral medication for the treatment of
erectile dysfunction. Since launch, doctors have written over 17 million
prescriptions for Viagra tablets for more than 6 million patients in the U.S.
alone. More than 150 million tablets have been dispensed worldwide.

     Our other major pharmaceutical products include GLUCOTROL XL, for the
treatment of diabetes, and ZYRTEC, which is used for the treatment of allergies
and related problems. ZYRTEC is licensed to us by the Belgian company UCB S.A.
for sales in the U.S. and Canada. We co-promote ZYRTEC in the U.S. with a
subsidiary of UCB S.A.

     In February 1999, we participated in the launch of CELEBREX with G.D.
Searle & Co. (Searle), a division of Monsanto Company, the discoverer and
developer of CELEBREX. CELEBREX is used for the relief of symptoms of adult
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. We co-promote CELEBREX with Searle in
all world markets except Japan.

CONSUMER HEALTH CARE GROUP

     Our  Consumer   Health  Care  Group   products   include   non-prescription
over-the-counter (OTC) medications,  therapeutic skin care products and personal
care products.  Among our better-known brands in the U.S. are:

o    VISINE eye care

o    BENGAY topical analgesics

o    CORTIZONE hydrocortisone skin cream

o    RID anti-lice products

o    UNISOM sleep aids

o    DESITIN ointments for treatment of diaper rash

o    PLAX pre-brushing dental rinse

o    BARBASOL shave creams and gels

Several product-line extensions building on these brands have been introduced in
recent years. Other products are sold only in selected international markets.
Sales of the Consumer Health Care Group accounted for about 4% of our total
revenues in 1999 and 1998 and 5% in 1997.

     Our Consumer Health Care Group can extend the life of some of our
prescription medications by converting them to OTC medications. For example, an
OTC formulation of DIFLUCAN, known as DIFLUCAN ONE, is sold in the U.K. as a
treatment for vaginal candidiasis. Similarly, ZYRTEC is sold as an OTC product
in Canada under the brand name REACTINE. As market conditions permit, and when
we have necessary approval from drug regulatory authorities, we plan to pursue
similar launches for other products.

ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT

     Pfizer's Animal Health Group discovers, develops, manufactures and sells
products for the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock, poultry and
companion animals. Among the products we produce are antibiotics,
antiparasitics, anti-inflammatories, vaccines and related products for livestock
and companion animals. Our Animal Health Group

                                       3
<PAGE>

revenues grew 2% to $1.3 billion in 1999, in part due to the successful launch
of the new antiparasitic for dogs and cats, REVOLUTION (marketed as STRONGHOLD
in Europe), and continued growth from the canine anti-arthritic Rimadyl. These
benefits were offset by continuing weakness in the livestock market in the U.S.
and Europe. Animal Health sales accounted for approximately 8% of our total
revenues in 1999, 10% of our total revenues in 1998 and 12% of our total
revenues in 1997.

     The $1.3 billion worldwide pet antiparasitic market consists of medicines
for external parasites such as fleas and ticks, treatments for gastrointestinal
worms, and heartworm preventatives. Our product REVOLUTION is the first product
to treat all three problems. This once-a-month, simple-to-administer, topical
liquid protects against internal and external parasites, including heartworm,
fleas, and ear mites in both dogs and cats; American dog ticks and sarcoptic
mange in dogs; and hookworm and roundworm in cats. The U. S. launch of
REVOLUTION was one of the most successful in the history of animal health.

     Since its introduction in 1997, nearly five million arthritic dogs
worldwide have been treated with RIMADYL to relieve acute and chronic pain
associated with osteoarthritis, a condition that afflicts about 15% of all dogs.
The new chewable form provides the pet owner with greater convenience of
administration.

     Other important Pfizer companion animal products include VANGUARD vaccines
for canine enteric disease, LEUKOCELL vaccines for feline leukemia,
CLAVAMOX/SYNULOX anti-infectives, and ANIPRYL for Cushing's disease and
Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome in dogs.

     Our Animal Health Group produces leading antiparasitic products, vaccines
and anti-infectives for cattle, swine and poultry. Among these are DECTOMAX to
protect cattle, swine and sheep from internal and external parasites, and
RESPISURE/STELLAMUNE vaccines to prevent a type of pneumonia and the related
problems of slow weight gains, decreased feed efficiency, and lack of uniformity
in size in swine.

     Other products for livestock include TERRAMYCIN LA-200, an injectable
version of the TERRAMYCIN broad-spectrum antibiotic used for various animal
diseases; VALBAZEN and PARATECT products to treat internal parasites and
BOVISHIELD vaccine for cattle respiratory disease.

      The council of European Agricultural Ministers voted to ban the use of our
antibiotic feed additive STAFAC (virginiamycin) throughout the European Union
after June 1999. We do not expect the ban on sales of STAFAC to have a material
effect on the Company's future results of operations.

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

      Innovation by our research and development operations is very important to
the success of our businesses. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to
market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs. This goal has
been supported by our substantial research and development investments. We spent
approximately $2.8 billion in 1999, $2.3 billion in 1998 and $1.8 billion in
1997 on research and development.

      We are planning for future growth of our research operations. Current
construction at our three major research centers will add approximately two
million square feet of laboratory space. Other research facilities are also
being added or expanded.

      We conduct research internally, and also through contracts with third
parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies
and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms. We also seek out innovative
technologies developed by third parties to acquire or incorporate into our
product lines through licensing or other arrangements.

      Drug development is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. On
average, only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by
researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an
approved medicine. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take
more than ten years. Candidates can fail at any

                                       4
<PAGE>

stage of the process, and even late-stage product candidates could fail to
receive regulatory approval.

      In view of the limited period of patent protection, and to gain the
marketing advantage of being first to market in a particular therapeutic
category, we try to be efficient as well as careful in our new product
development. We strive to minimize delays in handling new product candidates and
look for opportunities such as contracting studies to outside researchers, to
move development forward effectively and efficiently.

     We feel that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number
of pharmaceutical compounds and new therapies we have in all stages of
development. In recent years, our discovery scientists have delivered dozens of
new chemical compounds to early development. While each new candidate is far
from regulatory approval, new drug candidates are the foundation for future
products. A table and discussion of supplemental filings for existing products
and drug candidates in development are set out under the heading PRODUCT
DEVELOPMENTS beginning on page 30 of our 1999 Annual Report. That discussion is
incorporated by reference.

     Our research operations add value to our existing products by improving
their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them. In 1999, for example,
the FDA approved the additional use of ZOLOFT for the treatment of posttraumatic
stress disorder.

     Our competitors also devote substantial sums and resources to research and
development. In addition, the consolidation that has occurred in our industry
has created companies with substantial research and development resources. The
competition fostered by the fruits of this research could result in erosion of
sales and unanticipated product obsolescence.


INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

     We have significant operations outside the United States. They are
conducted both through our subsidiaries and through distributors, and involve
the same business segments - pharmaceutical and animal health - as our U.S.
operations.

     Japan is our second-largest single national market, with 8% of our total
revenues in 1999, 7% in 1998 and 9% in 1997. No single country outside the U.S.
had revenues of 10% of our total revenues.

     For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the table GEOGRAPHIC DATA on
page 60 of our 1999 Annual Report. That information is incorporated by
reference.

     Our international businesses are subject, in varying degrees, to a number
of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. These include:

o    currency fluctuations

o    capital and exchange control regulations

o    expropriation and nationalization

o    other restrictive government actions

Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints,
including laws on pricing or reimbursement for use of products. See the section
under the heading GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS for discussion of
those matters.

     Revenue growth in 1999 was not significantly impacted by foreign exchange.
In 1998, currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar reduced our reported
revenues in many countries. Depending on the direction of change relative to the
U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can either improve or reduce the reported
dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. We cannot predict with
certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have
on us. We attempt to anticipate such changes, however, and try to mitigate their
effects. See Note 4-D to our financial statements, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS, on pages 46 and 47 in our 1999 Annual Report. That discussion is
incorporated

financial instruments in parts E and F of that same Note is also incorporated by

MARKETING

     In our global pharmaceuticals business, we promote our products to health
care providers such as doctors, nurse practitioners and hospitals, Pharmacy
Benefit Managers and Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). We also market directly
to consumers in the United States through direct-to-consumer print and
television advertising. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate
the public about our innovative medical research.

     Our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations. Each
sales organization markets a distinct group of products. We increased our sales
force over the past several years so that our recently introduced products and
late-stage candidates will reach their full potential. Our U.S. pharmaceutical
sales representatives total approximately 5,400. This number reflects the
creation of a new primary-care sales force and a specialty sales force dedicated
largely to rheumatology, as well as the expansion of other specialty sales
forces in the U.S. Overseas operations employ about 11,300 sales
representatives.

     Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to
wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, including hospitals,
clinics, government agencies and pharmacies.

     Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses and
advantages of our products to medical professionals. We work to gain access to
MCO formularies (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products
compiled by pharmacists and physicians) by demonstrating the qualities and
treatment benefits of our products. We also work with MCOs to assist them with
disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical
treatment routines.

     Marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals depends to a degree on complex
decisions about the scope of clinical trials made years before product approval.
All drugs must complete clinical trials required by regulatory authorities to
show they are safe and effective for treating one or more particular medical
problems. A manufacturer may choose, however, to undertake additional studies to
demonstrate additional advantages of a compound, including comparative clinical
trials with competitive products.

     Those studies can be costly, can take years to complete and the results are
uncertain. Balancing these considerations makes it difficult to decide whether
and when to undertake such additional studies. But, when they are successful,
such studies can have a major impact on approved marketing claims and
strategies.

     Our Consumer Health Care Group uses its own representatives to promote its
products. We use print and television consumer advertising for our consumer
health care products. Those products are sold through various retailers.

     Separate sales organizations also are used by our Animal Health business to
promote its products. Its advertising and promotion are generally targeted to
health professionals, directly and through medical journals. Animal health and
nutrition products are sold through veterinarians, drug wholesalers,
distributors, retail outlets and directly to users. Where appropriate, these
products are also marketed through print and television advertising.

     During 1999, pharmaceutical sales to our three largest pharmaceutical and
consumer health care products wholesalers were:

o    McKesson HBOC, Inc. - 14% of our total revenues;

o    Cardinal Health, Inc. - 12% of our total revenues; and

o    Bindley Western Industries, Inc. - 7% of our total revenues.

     Those sales were concentrated in the Pharmaceutical segment. Apart from
these


                                       6
<PAGE>


instances, none of our business segments is dependent on any one or group of
related customers.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

     Our products are sold around the world under brand-name trademarks we
consider in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark protection
continues in some countries as long as the mark is used; in other countries, as
long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable,
terms.

     We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents. These patents
cover:

o    pharmaceutical products and their uses

o    pharmaceutical formulations

o    product manufacturing processes

o    intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing

     Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the
date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by
a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the
country.

     In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of material importance
to our businesses in the United States and most other countries. Based on
current product sales, and considering the vigorous competition with products
sold by others, the patent rights we consider significant in relation to our
business as a whole are those for NORVASC, CARDURA, ZYRTEC, ZITHROMAX, ZOLOFT,
DIFLUCAN, GLUCOTROL XL and VIAGRA. Our basic U.S. patents relating to NORVASC,
ZOLOFT, DIFLUCAN, GLUCOTROL XL and VIAGRA expire between 2004 and 2011. The U.S.
patent on CARDURA expires in 2000.

     PROCARDIA XL employs a novel sustained-release drug-delivery system
developed and patented by Alza Corporation. We hold an exclusive license to use
this delivery system with the active ingredient in PROCARDIA XL. The patents on
the system run until 2003. Other companies also offer sustained-release forms of
that ingredient or have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of such
products. One such product that has been approved has not been rated by the FDA
to be appropriate for substitution in place of PROCARDIA XL. Another product was
approved by the FDA in December, 1999, and rated therapeutically equivalent.
Additional products were filed for FDA approval in 1998 which appear to infringe
our patents (see the discussion of all of these matters in Item 3, LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS, below. Also see the discussion below about PROCARDIA XL sales in
the section CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS). It is not
possible to predict the timing and impact on sales of PROCARDIA XL of
competition from other products.

     ZITHROMAX is patented by Pliva, a Croatian pharmaceutical company. The drug
is licensed exclusively to us by Pliva for sales and marketing in major
countries, and we purchase the compound in bulk crude form from Pliva. Pliva's
U.S. patent on ZITHROMAX expires in 2005.

     ZYRTEC is patented by the Belgian company, UCB S.A. The drug is licensed
exclusively to us for sales in the U.S. and semi-exclusively with UCB S.A. For
sales in Canada. The U.S. patent on ZYRTEC held by UCB S.A. expires in 2007.

     We have other patent rights covering additional products that have smaller
sales revenues.

     We expect that the patents on some of our newest products and late-stage
product candidates could become significant to our business as a whole in the
future.

     The expiration of a product patent normally results in significant
competition from generic products against the covered product and, particularly
in the U.S., can result in a dramatic

                                       7
<PAGE>

reduction in sales of the pioneering product. In some cases, however, we can
continue to obtain commercial benefits from:

o    product manufacturing trade secrets

o    patents on uses for products

o    patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of
     the active ingredients

o    patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms

o    conversion of the active ingredient to over-the-counter products

     The effect of product patent expiration also depends upon:

o    the nature of the market and the position of the product in it

o    the growth of the market

o    the complexities and economics of manufacture of the product

o    the requirements of generic drug laws

     One of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the
U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection of our products.
Under international agreements in recent years, global protection of
intellectual property rights is improving. The General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws
to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a
ten-year transition period. A number of countries are doing this. We have
experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and
our continued business expansion in those countries depends to a large degree on
further patent protection improvement.


COMPETITION

     Competition is intense in all of our businesses, and includes many large
and small competitors. The principal means of competition varies among product
categories and business groups. Technological innovations affecting:

o    efficacy

o    safety

o    patients' ease of use

o    cost effectiveness

are important to success in all of our businesses. Our businesses also focus on
unmet medical needs and therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation has
led to our multi-billion-dollar research and development investments over the
past decade.

     Our pharmaceutical business competes with worldwide research-based drug
companies, many smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus
and generic drug manufacturers. Our pharmaceutical operations are among the
largest in the world.

     In recent years, a comparison of the total cost of medical treatments using
pharmaceuticals versus alternative treatments for the same condition has become
an important basis of competition. Managed Care Organizations and Pharmacy
Benefit Managers look to cost advantages as well as medical benefits in making
their drug formulary decisions.

     Our pharmaceutical sales and marketing organization is a valuable
competitive asset. Our salespeople's ability to reach medical professionals with
information about our products helps us respond to competitive efforts and
launch new products.

     Many other companies, large and small, manufacture and sell one or more
products that are similar to our consumer health care products. Sources of
competitive advantage in the OTC market include:

o    product quality and efficacy

                                       8
<PAGE>

o    brand identity

o    advertising and promotion

o    product innovation

o    broad distribution capabilities

o    customer satisfaction

o    price

Significant expenditures for advertising,  promotion and marketing are generally
required to achieve consumer acceptance of consumer health care products.

     We have a significant presence in the animal health marketplace, but many
other companies offer competitive products. Altogether, there are hundreds of
producers of animal health products throughout the world. The principal methods
of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product. They include:

o    product innovation

o    service

o    price

o    quality

o    effective promotion to veterinary professionals and consumers

We promote our products  directly through our sales  representatives  as well as
through advertising.

     In the current environment of competitive pressures on profit margins, we
continue efforts to control the growth of our expenses. Although research and
development budgets have grown significantly, we have kept our costs down in
other areas such as manufacturing, distribution and sales administration by
restructuring and consolidating facilities. These measures have brought us new
efficiencies and reduced or contained our operating expenses.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

     The growth of Managed Care Organizations in the U.S. has been a major
factor in the competitive make-up of the health care marketplace. Over half the
U.S. population now participates in some version of managed care. Because of the
size of the patient population covered by MCOs, marketing of prescription drugs
to them and the Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) that serve many of those
organizations has become important to our business.

     MCOs can include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators,
health-maintenance organizations, alliances of hospitals and physicians and
other physician organizations. The purchasing power of MCOs has been increasing
in recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients. At the same
time, those organizations have been consolidating into fewer, even larger
entities. This enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us.

     A major objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce health
care expenditures. They typically use formularies, volume purchases and
long-term contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers. They
use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices. They also
emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment, and procedures
performed at doctors' offices and clinics. Hospitalization and surgery,
typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed.

     As discussed above in MARKETING, MCOs and PBMs typically develop
formularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies can be based on
the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products. Due to their
lower cost, generic medicines are often favored. The breadth of the products
covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many
formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of
particular medical problems. MCOs use a variety of means to encourage patients'
use of products listed on their formularies.

     Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced
usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies
compete aggressively to have their products included. Where possible,

                                       9
<PAGE>

companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products,
such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A
lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that
demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based
primarily on price.

     The growth of MCOs also appears to have led to greater usage of some drugs.
The use of certain drugs can prevent the need for more costly treatments such as
hospitalization, professional therapy or even surgery. Because of these
advantages, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments. In addition,
the current trend of some patients to opt for managed care alternatives to
Medicare may increase overall pharmaceutical usage among that elderly
population. Medicare generally does not pay for medicines, so patients who do
not have another source of prescription drug coverage must bear that cost. MCOs,
however, often offer drug benefits for their participants.

     These developments have not only created pressure on prices, but also have
increased sales of products on formularies. We have been generally, although not
universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO
formularies.

     Another way we address the interests of MCOs is by developing disease
management programs. These programs can be attractive to MCOs by improving
patient communications and compliance with dosage directions, which are
important for effective disease treatment. They can help MCOs address various
aspects of disease management, such as prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
certain diseases, including use of pharmaceutical products. This comprehensive
approach can improve the quality of care and lower costly complications of
chronic diseases.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

     One of the biggest competitive challenges we face in the U.S. is from
generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration of U.S. patent
protection on an important product, we can lose the major portion of U.S. sales
of the product within a year. Generic competitors operate without our large
research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information
about the product to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval
process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to
demonstrate their safety and efficacy, and allows generic manufacturers to rely
on the safety and efficacy of the pioneer product. Generic products need only
demonstrate a level of availability in the blood stream equivalent to that of
the pioneer product. This means that after we have borne the expenses of
discovering, developing and testing a medicine for safety and efficacy,
obtaining regulatory approval and informing the medical community about its
therapeutic benefits, generic competitors can charge much less for a competing
version of our product and still be profitable.

     As noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs
may favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the
use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their health care
programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and
in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been
rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to a
brand-name drug. The substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician
expressly forbids it.

RAW MATERIALS

     Raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the
ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials
are available from multiple sources. No serious shortages or delays were
encountered in 1999, and none are expected in 2000.

                                       10
<PAGE>

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

     Pharmaceutical companies are subject to heavy regulation by a number of
national, state and local agencies. Of particular importance is the FDA in the
United States. It has jurisdiction over all our businesses and administers
requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, approval,
manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our pharmaceutical products. In some
cases, FDA requirements and/or reviews have increased the amount of time and
money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market.

     The FDA also regulates our consumer health care products and, along with
the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency, our
animal health products. Some regulatory actions pertaining to our products are
discussed in Item 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, below.

     Since the beginning of 1998, the approval of new drugs across the EU is
possible only using the European Medicines Evaluation Agency's (EMEA) mutual
recognition or central approval processes. The use of either of these procedures
should provide a more rapid and consistent approval across all fifteen member
states than was the case when the approval processes were operating
independently within each member state. Further, on January 1, 2000, Norway and
Iceland became full participants in the EU central approval processes. In
addition, the agreement between the EU and ten Eastern European states to base
their approvals on the centralized EU approval will significantly speed the
regulatory process in those countries. The EMEA does not have jurisdiction over
patient reimbursement or pricing matters in EU member countries, however. We
will continue to deal with individual countries on such issues.

     In recent years, various legislative proposals have been offered in
Congress and in some state legislatures that would bring about major changes in
the affected health care systems. Some states have passed such legislation, and
further federal and state proposals are possible. These could include price or
patient reimbursement constraints on medicines and restrictions on access to
certain products. Similar issues exist in many foreign countries where we do
business. We cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives, but we will work to
maintain patient access to our products and to oppose price constraints.

     Also in the U.S., proposals have called for substantial changes in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. If such changes are enacted, they may require
significant reductions from currently projected government expenditures for
these programs. Driven by budget concerns, Medicaid managed care systems have
been implemented in several states. If the Medicare and Medicaid programs
implement changes that restrict the access of a significant population of
patients to our innovative medicines, our business could be materially affected.
On the other hand, relatively little pharmaceutical use is currently covered by
Medicare. As noted above, if changes to these programs shift patients to MCOs
that cover pharmaceuticals, or drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries is
expanded, usage of pharmaceuticals could increase.

     Legislation in the U.S. requires us to give rebates to state Medicaid
agencies based on each state's reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under
the Medicaid program. We also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or
reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state
agencies and programs. See the discussion regarding rebates on page 30 of our
1999 Annual Report for details on the cost to us of such discounts and rebates,
which is incorporated by reference.

     We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other
countries. For example, in 1997, Japan announced a price reduction on drugs. In
Europe and some other international markets, the government provides health care
at low direct cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient

                                       11
<PAGE>

reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care
system.

     This international patchwork of price regulation has led to inconsistent
prices and some third-party trade in our products from markets with low prices.
Such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our
sales in markets with higher prices.

     We are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other regulatory and
enforcement departments and agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human
Services, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice in the
U.S., and are, therefore, subject to possible administrative and legal
proceedings and actions by those organizations (see Item 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,
below). Such actions may include product recalls, seizures and other civil and
criminal sanctions. In some cases, we have initiated product recalls
voluntarily.

     It is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding
legislative and regulatory requirements affecting us.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

     Most of our manufacturing and certain research operations are affected by
federal, state and local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to
continue to make, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. We
are also cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity
at certain sites (see Item 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, below). As a result, we
incurred capital and operational expenditures in 1999 for environmental
protection and clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows:

o    environmental-related capital expenditures -- $66 million

o    other environmental-related expenses -- $88 million

While we cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such clean-up
activities, capital expenditures, or operating costs for environmental
compliance, we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

YEAR 2000

     We have not experienced any operational problems as a result of Year 2000
issues, and Year 2000 had no material effect on our revenues. Although the
transition from 1999 to 2000 did not adversely impact our Company, there can be
no assurances that we will not experience any negative effects or disruptions in
our businesses in the future as a result of Year 2000 issues.

     The total cost of our Year 2000 Program was $130 million, of which we
incurred $94 million in 1999, $31 million in 1998 and $5 million in 1997. These
costs were expensed as incurred, except for capitalizable hardware of
approximately $8 million in 1999, $4 million in 1998 and $1 million in 1997, and
were funded through operating cash flows. Such costs did not include normal
system upgrades and replacements.

CORPORATE/FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARIES

     We conduct international banking operations through a subsidiary, Pfizer
International Bank Europe (PIBE), based in Dublin, Ireland. PIBE, incorporated
under the laws of Ireland, operates under a banking license from the Central
Bank of Ireland. It makes loans and accepts deposits in several currencies in
international markets. PIBE is an active Euromarket lender to high quality
corporations and governments through its portfolio of loans and money market
instruments. Loans are made primarily on a short and medium term basis,
typically with floating interest rates.

     We also own an insurance operation, The Kodiak Company Limited, which
reinsures certain assets, inland transport and marine cargo of our international
operations. Financial data for these subsidiaries are set out in Note 3 to our
financial statements, FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARIES, on pages 44 and 45 in our 1999
Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference.

TAX MATTERS

     The discussion of tax-related matters (including certain proceedings
involving proposed tax adjustments relating to prior years) in Note 9 to our
financial statements, TAXES ON INCOME, on pages 49 and 50 in our 1999 Annual
Report is incorporated by reference.

EMPLOYEES

     In our innovation-intensive business, our employees are vital to our
success. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. As of
December 31, 1999, we employed approximately 50,900 people in our operations
throughout the world. Geographically, this total breaks down as follows:

o    United States, 19,300

o    Europe, 14,400

o    Asia, 6,600

o    Canada/Latin America, 5,900

o    Africa/Middle East, 4,700

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE
SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995)

OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS REPORT AND IN OUR 1999 ANNUAL REPORT TO
SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
GIVE OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS. YOU CAN IDENTIFY
THESE STATEMENTS BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR
CURRENT FACTS. THEY USE WORDS SUCH AS "ANTICIPATE," "ESTIMATE," "EXPECT,"
"PROJECT," "INTEND," "PLAN," "BELIEVE," AND OTHER WORDS AND TERMS OF SIMILAR
MEANING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE ACTIONS,

WARNER-LAMBERT DISCUSSED UNDER THE HEADING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND FINANCIAL
RESULTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO MAY PROVIDE ORAL OR WRITTEN FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS IN OTHER MATERIALS WE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC.

ANY OR ALL OF OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT, IN THE 1999 ANNUAL
REPORT AND IN ANY OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS WE MAKE MAY TURN OUT TO BE WRONG. THEY
CAN BE AFFECTED BY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS WE MIGHT MAKE OR BY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY FACTORS MENTIONED IN THE DISCUSSION ABOVE - FOR
EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, YEAR 2000 SYSTEMS COMPLIANCE,
GENERIC PRODUCT COMPETITION AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT - WILL BE IMPORTANT
IN DETERMINING FUTURE RESULTS. CONSEQUENTLY, NO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE
GUARANTEED. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,
WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE
ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED SUBJECTS
IN OUR 10-Q AND 8-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING
CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE
ASSUMPTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT WE THINK COULD
CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL
RESULTS. OTHER FACTORS BESIDES THOSE LISTED HERE COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
COMPANY. THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES
LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.


^ Balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major
challenge. Our ongoing investments in new product introductions and research and
development for future products could exceed corresponding sales growth. This
could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues.

^ In the U.S., many of our pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing
pricing pressures, which could be significantly impacted

                                       13
<PAGE>

by the outcome of the current national debate over Medicare reform. If the
Medicare program provided outpatient pharmaceutical coverage for its
beneficiaries, the federal government, through its enormous purchasing power
under the program, could demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies that may
implicitly create price controls on prescription drugs. On the other hand, a
Medicare drug reimbursement provision may increase the volume of pharmaceutical
drug purchases, offsetting, at least in part, these potential price discounts.
In addition, managed care organizations, institutions and other government
agencies continue to seek price discounts. Government efforts to reduce Medicare
and Medicaid expenses are expected to increase the use of managed care
organizations. This may result in managed care influencing prescription
decisions for a larger segment of the population. International operations are
also subject to price and market regulations. As a result, it is expected that
pressures on pricing and operating results will continue.

^ Thirty-nine percent of our 1999 revenues arose from international operations,
and we expect revenue and net income growth in 2000 to be impacted by changes in
foreign exchange rates. Revenues from Asia comprised approximately 11% of total
revenues in 1999, including 8% from Japan.

     These international-based revenues as well as our substantial international
assets result in our exposure to currency exchange rate changes. In addition,
our interest-bearing investments, loans and borrowings are subject to interest
rate change risk. The risks of such changes and the measures we have taken to
help contain those risks are discussed in the section entitled FINANCIAL RISK
MANAGEMENT on page 36 in our 1999 Annual Report. For additional details, see
Note 4-D to our financial statements, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, on pages
46 and 47 in our 1999 Annual Report. Those sections of the Annual Report are
incorporated by reference.

     Notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes
in fiscal circumstances, we cannot predict with certainty all changes in
currency and interest rates, inflation or other related factors affecting our
businesses. These factors could affect future results.

^ A new European currency (euro) was introduced in January 1999 to replace the
separate currencies of eleven individual countries. The major changes during its
first year of existence have occurred in the banking and financial sectors. The
impact at the commercial and retail level has been limited but is expected to
increase during the next two years through December 31, 2001, when the separate
currencies will cease to exist. We are modifying systems and commercial
arrangements to deal with the new currency, including the availability of dual
currency processes to permit transactions to be denominated in the separate
currencies, as well as the euro. The cost of this effort is not expected to have
a material effect on our businesses or results of operations. We continue to
evaluate the economic and operational impact of the euro, including its impact
on competition, pricing and foreign currency exchange risks. There is no
guarantee, however, that all problems have been foreseen and corrected, or that
no material disruption will occur in our businesses.

^ International operations could be affected by changes in intellectual property
legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and procedures and actions
affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of
products, as well as by unstable governments and legal systems,
intergovernmental disputes and possible nationalization.

^ Cost-containment measures employed by governments that have the effect of
limiting patient access to medicines and related issues described above in
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS affect the growth and profitability
of our operations in some countries. Those factors could affect future results.

^ Business combinations among our competitors could affect our competitive
position in the pharmaceutical, consumer health care and animal health
businesses. Similarly,

combinations among our major customers could increase their purchasing power in
dealing with us. In addition, our proposed merger with Warner-Lambert could
affect our business, finances and capital structure. While we anticipate
earnings and revenues growth, as well as substantial cost savings and operating
efficiencies to be achieved in connection with the merger with Warner-Lambert,
we cannot give any assurance that these results will be realized in the combined
company within the time periods contemplated or even if they will be realized at
all.

^ Generic competition is a major challenge in the U.S. Loss of patent
protection typically leads to dramatic loss of sales in the U.S. market and
could affect future results.

^ Risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to product-related
forward-looking statements. The outcome of the lengthy and complex process of
identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain.
Prospective products can fail to receive regulatory approval. There are also
many considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical products around
the world. Regulatory delays, the inability to successfully complete clinical
trials, claims and concerns about safety and efficacy, new discoveries, patents
and products by competitors and related patent disputes and claims about adverse
side effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the
realization of research and development and product-related forward-looking
statements.

^ As discussed above in MARKETING, decisions about research studies made early
in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on
the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval. More detailed studies
may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they
consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for
initial approval. We try to plan clinical trials prudently, but there is no
guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case.
The quality of our decisions in this area can affect our future results.

^ Difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing, including, but
not limited to, the inability to build up production capacity commensurate with
demand, or the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance
of approved products could affect future results.

^ We currently have seven products with annual sales to third parties exceeding
one billion dollars. In this group are five medicines discovered by PFIZER -
NORVASC, ZITHROMAX, ZOLOFT, VIAGRA and DIFLUCAN - and our alliance products
LIPITOR and CELEBREX. Those products accounted for more than half of our 1999
revenues. If these or any of our other major products were to become subject to
a problem such as loss of patent protection, unexpected side effects, regulatory
proceedings, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from
competitive products, or if a new, more effective treatment should be
introduced, the impact on our revenues could be significant.

^ We cannot always predict with accuracy the timing or impact of possible future
competition on sales of our products. for example, PROCARDIA XL, our patented
form of sustained-release nifedipine, has been an important product for us, but
its sales have been declining, and we expect that to continue. Sales of
PROCARDIA XL were $822 million in 1997, $714 million in 1998 and $521 million in
1999. This decline has been due, at least in part, to the medical community's
increased emphasis on our more advanced product, NORVASC. It is also partly
attributable to the fact that there has been another form of sustained-release
nifedipine available on the market since 1993, although it is not approved for
treatment of all the same indications as PROCARDIA XL. Additional potentially
competitive products have been filed for FDA approval, one of which was approved
by the FDA in December, 1999 (see the discussion in Item 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,
below). This indicates that the number of medicines that compete with PROCARDIA
XL may increase, and

                                       15
<PAGE>

the sales of competing products may affect our expected results.

^ During 1995, the authors of some non-clinical studies questioned the safety of
calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Although the clinical evidence supported the
safety of this class of medications, the FDA convened an advisory panel to
review their safety. In 1996, that advisory panel found no data to support
challenges to the safety of newer sustained-release and intrinsically
long-acting CCBs (such as NORVASC and PROCARDIA XL - products for treatment of
hypertension and angina).

     Questions about this class of products continued throughout 1997, however,
and included scientific publications and presentations asserting that these
products were associated with various serious medical conditions.

     During 1997, data from newly conducted studies and reviews and decisions by
two national regulatory authorities, plus newly published National Institutes of
Health guidelines, were all supportive of the safety of long-acting CCBs like
NORVASC AND PROCARDIA XL and of their appropriateness as first-line medications
in the treatment of hypertension.

     We continue to believe that the safety and effectiveness of NORVASC and
PROCARDIA XL are supported by a large body of data from numerous studies and the
daily clinical experiences of physicians around the world. It is not possible,
however, to predict the impact on our future sales, if any, of existing or
future studies, regulatory agency actions or a continuing debate regarding CCBs.

^ Growth in costs and expenses, changes in product mix and the impact of
divestitures, restructuring and other unusual items that could result from
evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization and organizational
restructuring could affect future results. For example, we may be unable to
maintain or further enhance those margin improvements achieved in recent years,
which would affect future results.

^ In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 137, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES - DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB
STATEMENT NO. 133. This pronouncement requires us to adopt SFAS No. 133,
ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, on January 1,
2001. SFAS No. 133 requires a company to recognize all derivative instruments as
assets or liabilities in its balance sheet and measure them at fair value.

     Such new or revised accounting standards and rules are issued from time to
time. Although the standard mentioned above is not expected to have a material
impact on our reported financial results, future standards and rules could have
such an effect.

^ As described above in the section YEAR 2000, we have not experienced any
operational problems as a result of Year 2000 issues, and Year 2000 had no
material effect on our revenues. Although the transition from 1999 to 2000 did
not adversely impact our Company, there can be no assurances that we will not
experience any negative effects or disruptions in our businesses in the future
as a result of Year 2000 issues.

^ Changes in the U.S. Tax Code and the tax laws of other countries can affect
our net earnings. For example, pursuant to the Small Jobs Protection Act of 1996
(the ACT), Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code was repealed for tax years
beginning after December 31, 1995. Section 936 had created the U.S. possessions
corporation income tax credit, which gave us tax benefits for certain operations
in Puerto Rico. The Act provided that as an existing credit claimant, we are
eligible to continue using the credit against the tax arising from our
manufacturing income earned in Puerto Rico for an additional ten-year period.
The amount of manufacturing income eligible for the credit during this
additional period is subject to a cap based on income earned prior to 1996 in
Puerto Rico. This ten-year extension does not apply to investment income earned
in Puerto Rico, the credit on which expired as of

                                       16
<PAGE>

July 1, 1996. The Act did not affect the amendments made to Section 936 by the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which provided for a five-year
phase-down of the U.S. possession tax credit from 100% to 40%. In addition, the
Act permitted the extension of the R&D tax credit through June 30, 1998. In
1998, this credit was again extended to June 30, 1999, and in 1999, it was
further extended to June 30, 2004.

^ Claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries for various legal,
environmental and tax matters, and additional claims arise from time to time. In
addition, our operations are subject to international, federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations. It is possible that our cash flows and
results of operations could be affected by the one-time impact of the resolution
of these contingencies. We believe that the ultimate disposition of current
matters to the extent not previously provided for will not have a material
impact on our financial condition or cash flows and results of operations,
except where specifically commented upon in the discussion of such matters in
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS in Item 3 in this report, in TAX MATTERS above and in Note 9
to our financial statements, TAXES ON INCOME, on pages 49 and 50 in our 1999
Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     Our world headquarters is located in several buildings in New York City. We
own two of these buildings, including our main 33-story office tower, and rent
space in others nearby. The 33-story office tower is located on a site we have
leased under a long-term ground lease. Altogether, our headquarters operations
occupy over 1.6 million square feet of owned and leased office space in New York
City.

     Our pharmaceutical business owns and leases space for sales and marketing,
administrative support and customer service functions around the world.

     Our major research and development facilities are located in
manufacturing/R&D complexes that we own containing multiple buildings in Groton,
Connecticut; Sandwich, England and Nagoya, Japan. The buildings at our Groton
facility currently contain approximately 3.5 million square feet of floor space.
Approximately 1 million square feet is used for manufacturing, and the rest is
used for research and development. The Company also began construction in 1998
on an additional 750,000 square-foot facility on a 24-acre site in nearby New
London, Connecticut, to initially house 1,300 employees from the Company's
research operations.

     Buildings on our 334-acre Sandwich, England campus house research, our U.K.
pharmaceutical sales office and a production plant. These facilities contain
almost 2 million square feet of floor space, approximately half of which is used
for research and development. An additional 900,000 square feet of new research
space is under construction.

     At our facility in Nagoya, Japan, the buildings contain 790,000 square feet
of floor space, of which 300,000 square feet is used for research.

     We own other important research facilities in Amboise, France and Terre
Haute, Indiana. A number of smaller research and development operations around
the world focus principally on their local markets. As discussed above, we have
been expanding our research and development facilities in recent years to meet
the challenges of handling growing research activities. In 1999, over 2.3
million square feet of research facilities was under construction at our sites
in Groton, Sandwich and Nagoya.

     Our Global Manufacturing Division operates 32 plants that produce products
for our pharmaceutical, consumer and animal health businesses around the world.
Twenty of these are major facilities. These plants handle one or more of three
basic types of production processes:

o    fermentation

o    organic synthesis

o    product production

                                       17
<PAGE>

We have four major fermentation plants:

o    Rixensart, Belgium

o    Sao Paulo, Brazil

o    Nagoya, Japan

o    Sandwich, England, U.K.

     Our major organic synthesis facilities are in four locations:

o    Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, U.S.

o    Groton, Connecticut, U.S.

o    Ringaskiddy, Ireland

o    Sandwich, England, U.K.

     We have major product production plants at seventeen sites in eleven
countries:

o    Amboise, France

o    Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, U.S.

o    Brooklyn, New York, U.S.

o    Dalian, China

o    Illertissen, Germany

o    Latina, Italy

o    Lee's Summit, Missouri, U.S.

o    Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.

o    Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium

o    Nagoya, Japan

o    Parsippany, New Jersey, U.S.

o    Sandwich, England, U.K.

o    San Jose Iturbide, Mexico

o    Sao Paulo, Brazil

o    Terre Haute, Indiana, U.S.

o    Toluca, Mexico

o    Valencia, Venezuela

     Our Consumer Health Care and Animal Health Groups have their principal
executive offices in leased facilities one block away from the Company's world
headquarters.

     Consumer Health Care has its principal research operations in Parsippany,
New Jersey. Consumer Health Care's sales and marketing offices are generally
leased and shared with local pharmaceutical sales offices, except in Mexico and
the U.K., where Consumer Health has separate offices.

     Animal Health owns its North American headquarters in Exton, Pennsylvania,
and leases some additional space in a nearby office building. It also owns
office space in Zaventem, Belgium, for support of its international operations.

     Most of Animal Health's research facilities are shared with our
pharmaceutical business.

     Our distribution operations in the U.S. include our large, state-of-the-art
distribution and order fulfillment operation in a 450,000 square-foot building
on a 20-acre site in Memphis, Tennessee, a new 190,000 square-foot distribution
center at our plant site in Parsippany, New Jersey, and a facility in Irvine,
California. A new West Coast distribution facility is under construction in
Reno, Nevada. The Animal Health Group also operates its own distribution
facilities. We also operate distribution facilities in major markets around the
world.

     In general, our properties are well maintained, adequate and suitable to
their purposes. The growth of our businesses has created space pressures for
certain operations, however. We have responded to such challenges with plans to
provide appropriate facilities as needs are demonstrated. Note 7 to our
financial statements, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT on page 48 in our 1999
Annual Report, which discloses amounts invested in land, buildings and
equipment, and the discussion of investing activities under the heading SUMMARY
OF CASH FLOWS on page 34 of our Annual Report, which describes our capital
expenditures, are incorporated by reference. See also the discussion under Note
11 entitled LEASE COMMITMENTS on page 52 of our Annual Report, which is also
incorporated by reference.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         The  Company  is  involved  in a  number  of  claims  and  litigations,
including  product  liability  claims and litigations  considered  normal in the
nature of its businesses.  These include suits involving various  pharmaceutical
and


                                       18
<PAGE>

hospital products that allege either reaction to or injury from use of the
product. In addition, from time to time the Company is involved in, or is the
subject of, various governmental or agency inquiries or investigations relating
to its businesses.

FORMER FOOD SCIENCE DIVISION

     In 1999, the Company pleaded guilty to one count of price fixing of sodium
erythorbate from July 1992 until December 1994, and one count of market
allocation of maltols from December 1989 until December 1995, and paid a total
fine of $20 million. The activities at issue involved the Company's former Food
Science Group, a division that manufactured food additives and that the Company
divested in 1996. The Department of Justice has stated that no further antitrust
charges will be brought against the Company relating to the former Food Science
Group, that no antitrust charges will be brought against any current director,
officer or employee of the Company for conduct related to the products of the
former Food Science Group, and that none of the Company's current directors,
officers or employees was aware of any aspect of the activity that gave rise to
the violations. Five purported class action suits involving these products have
been filed against the Company; two in California State Court, and three in New
York Federal Court. The Company does not believe that this plea and settlement,
or civil litigation involving these products, will have a material effect on its
business or results of operations.

NIFEDIPINE PATENTS

     On June 9, 1997, the Company received notice of the filing of an
Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) by Mylan pharmaceuticals for a
sustained-release nifedipine product asserted to be bioequivalent to PROCARDIA
XL. Mylan's notice asserted that the proposed formulation does not infringe
relevant licensed Alza and Bayer patents and thus that approval of their ANDA
should be granted before patent expiration. On July 18, 1997, the Company,
together with Bayer AG and Bayer Corporation, filed a patent-infringement suit
against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Laboratories Inc. in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania with respect to
Mylan's ANDA. Suit was filed under Bayer AG's U.S. Patent No. 5,264,446,
licensed to the Company, relating to nifedipine of a specified particle size
range. On March 16, 1999, the United States District Court granted Mylan's
motion to file an amended answer and antitrust counterclaims. On December 17,
1999, Mylan received final approval from the FDA for its 30 mg. extended-release
nifedipine tablet. On February 28, 2000, a settlement agreement was entered into
between Mylan and the Company under which the litigation was terminated and
Mylan will market a generic sustained-release nifedipine product manufactured by
the Company under its own trademark.

     On or about February 23, 1998, Bayer AG received notice that Biovail
Laboratories Incorporated had filed an ANDA for a sustained-release nifedipine
product asserted to be bioequivalent to one dosage strength (60 mg.) of
PROCARDIA XL. The notice was subsequently received by the Company as well. The
notice asserts that the Biovail product does not infringe Bayer's U.S. Patent
No. 5,264,446. On March 26, 1998, the Company received notice of the filing of
an ANDA by Biovail Laboratories of a 30 mg. dosage formulation of nifedipine
alleged to be bioequivalent to PROCARDIA XL. On April 2, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer
filed a patent-infringement action against Biovail, relating to their 60 mg.
nifedipine product, in the United States District Court for the District of
Puerto Rico. On May 6, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer filed a second patent infringement
action in Puerto Rico against Biovail under the same patent with respect to
Biovail's 30 mg. nifedipine product. These actions have been consolidated for
discovery and trial. On April 24, 1998, Biovail Laboratories Inc. brought suit
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania
against the Company and Bayer seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity of
and/or non-infringement of the 5,264,446 nifedipine patent as well as a finding
of violation of the antitrust laws. Biovail has also moved to

                                       19
<PAGE>

transfer the patent infringement actions from Puerto Rico to the Western
District of Pennsylvania. Pfizer has opposed this motion to transfer and on June
19, 1998, moved to dismiss Biovail's declaratory judgment action and antitrust
action in the Western District of Pennsylvania, or in the alternative, to stay
the action pending the outcome of the infringement actions in Puerto Rico. On
January 4, 1999, the District Court in Pennsylvania granted Pfizer's motion for
a stay of the antitrust action pending the outcome of the infringement actions
in Puerto Rico. On January 29, 1999, the District Court in Puerto Rico denied
Biovail's motion to transfer the patent infringement actions from Puerto Rico to
the Western District of Pennsylvania. On April 12, 1999, Biovail filed a motion
for summary judgment also based in part on the summary judgment motion granted
to Elan in the Bayer v. Elan litigation in the Northern District of Georgia.
Pfizer and Bayer's response was filed on April 26, 1999. On September 20, 1999,
the United States District Court in Puerto Rico denied Biovail's motion for
summary judgment without prejudice to their refiling after completion of
discovery in the PROCARDIA XL patent-infringement litigation. The court set an
expedited discovery schedule with a deadline of December 30, 1999, to complete
discovery of parties and fact witnesses and February 29, 2000, to complete
discovery of expert witnesses. On December 20, 1999, the court extended the date
to complete fact discovery to January 28, 2000, and that of expert discovery to
March 15, 2000. A status conference with the court scheduled for March 17, 2000,
has been postponed and a new date is awaited.

     On April 2, 1998, the Company received notice from Lek U.S.A. Inc. of its
filing of an ANDA for a 60 mg. formulation of nifedipine alleged to be
bioequivalent to PROCARDIA XL. On May 14, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer commenced suit
against Lek for infringement of Bayer's U.S. Patent No. 5,264,446, as well as
for infringement of a second Bayer patent, No. 4,412,986 relating to
combinations of nifedipine with certain polymeric materials. On September 14,
1998, Lek was served with the summons and complaint. Plaintiffs amended the
complaint on November 10, 1998, limiting the action to infringement of U.S.
Patent 4,412,986. On January 19, 1999, Lek filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint alleging infringement of U.S. Patent 4,412,986. Pfizer responded to
this motion and oral argument has been held in abeyance pending a settlement
conference. In September 1999, a settlement agreement was entered into among the
parties staying this litigation until the expiration of U.S. Patent No.
4,412,986 on November 2, 2000.

     On February 10, 1999, the Company received a notice from Lek U.S.A. of its
filing of an ANDA for a 90 mg. formulation of nifedipine alleged to be
bioequivalent to PROCARDIA XL. On March 25, 1999, Bayer and Pfizer commenced
suit against Lek for infringement of the same two Bayer patents originally
asserted against Lek's 60 mg. formulation. This case was also the subject of a
settlement conference. In September, 1999, a settlement agreement was entered
into among the parties staying this litigation until the expiration of U.S.
Patent No. 4,412,986 on November 2, 2000.

     On November 9, 1998, Pfizer received an ANDA notice letter from Martec
Pharmaceutical, Inc. for generic versions (30 MG., 60 MG., 90 MG.) OF PROCARDIA
XL. On or about December 18, 1998, Pfizer received a new ANDA certification
letter stating that the ANDA had actually been filed in the name of Martec
Scientific, Inc. On December 23, 1998, Pfizer brought an action against Martec
Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Martec Scientific, Inc. in the Western District of
Missouri for infringement of Bayer's patent relating to nifedipine of a specific
particle size. On January 26, 1999, a second complaint was filed against Martec
Scientific in the Western District of Missouri based on Martec's new ANDA
certification letter. Martec filed its response to this complaint on February
26, 1999. A hearing to determine claim scope is scheduled for June 1, 2000.

                                       20
<PAGE>

     Pfizer filed suit on July 8, 1997, against the FDA in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking a declaratory judgment and
injunctive relief enjoining the FDA from processing Mylan's ANDA or any other
ANDA submission referencing PROCARDIA XL that uses a different extended-release
mechanism. Pfizer's suit alleges that extended-release mechanisms that are not
identical to the osmotic pump mechanism of PROCARDIA XL constitute different
dosage forms requiring the filing and approval of suitability petitions under
the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act before the FDA can accept an ANDA for filing.
Mylan intervened in Pfizer's suit. On March 31, 1998, the U.S. District Judge
granted the government's motion for summary judgment against the Company. On
July 16, 1999, the D.C. Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on the ground that
since the FDA had not approved any ANDA referencing PROCARDIA XL that uses a
different extended-release mechanism than the osmotic pump mechanism of
PROCARDIA XL, it was premature to maintain this action, stating that Pfizer has
the right to bring such an action if, and when, the FDA approves such an ANDA.
Subsequent to FDA's final approval of Mylan's ANDA, on December 18, 1999 Pfizer
filed suit against FDA in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware. The suit alleges that FDA unlawfully approved Mylan's 30 mg. extended
release product because FDA had not granted an ANDA suitability petition
reflecting a difference in dosage form from PROCARDIA XL. As a result of the
settlement agreement with Mylan, Pfizer and the FDA have agreed to dismiss this
suit without prejudice.

DOXAZOSIN PATENT

     On March 31, 1999, the Company received notice from TorPharm of its filing,
through its U.S. agent Apotex Corp., of an ANDA for 1 mg., 2 mg., 4 mg. and 8
mg. tablets alleged to be bioequivalent to CARDURA (doxazosin mesylate). The
notice letter alleges that Pfizer's patent on doxazosin is invalid in view of
certain prior art references. Following a review of these allegations, suit was
filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
against TorPharm and Apotex Corp. on May 14, 1999. The defendants requested a
90-day period in which to file their answer. The request was granted and
TorPharm/Apotex's answer was filed by August 19, 1999. Discovery is in progress.
On June 2, 1999, FDA was notified that given the patent litigation and pursuant
to provisions of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA may not approve
the TorPharm application for thirty months from filing or resolution of the
litigation.

DRUG SCREENING PATENTS

     On May 5, 1999, the Company filed an action against Sibia Neurosciences,
Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking a
declaratory judgment that two Sibia patents claiming reporter gene drug
screening assays are invalid, not infringed by the Company, and unenforceable
due to Sibia's misuse of its patent rights in seeking certain license terms. On
May 27, 1999, Sibia Neurosciences, Inc. filed an answer to the Company's
declaratory judgment action in which Sibia denies that a prior case or
controversy existed, but admits that a case or controversy does now exist
regarding at least one patent in suit, denies the invalidity, unenforceability
and non-infringement of the patents in suit, and asserts various jurisdictional
and equitable defenses, affirmative defenses, and lack of standing by the
Company to assert patent misuse. Sibia Neurosciences also filed a counterclaim
alleging willful infringement by the Company of one of the patents in suit. A
reply to that counterclaim denying Sibia's allegation has been filed. The
parties submitted a joint status report to the court on December 14, 1999, in
which the parties agreed to complete fact discovery by August 21, 2000, and
commence trial on January 8, 2001.

TROVAFLOXACIN PATENT

         On May 19,  1999,  Abbott  Laboratories  filed an  action  against  the
Company in the United States District Court of the Northern District of Illinois
alleging that the Company's use, sale or manufacture of trovafloxacin  infringes
Abbott's United States Patent No.


                                       21
<PAGE>

4,616,019 claiming naphthyriding antibiotics and seeking a permanent injunction
and damages. An answer denying these allegations was filed on June 9, 1999.
Discovery is in progress.

ZOLOFT PATENTS

     On December 17, 1999, the Company received notice of the filing of an ANDA
by Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals for 50 mg. and 100 mg. tablets of sertraline
hydrochloride alleged to be bioequivalent to ZOLOFT. Zenith has certified to the
FDA that it will not engage in the manufacture, use or sale of sertraline
hydrochloride until the expiration of Pfizer's U.S. Patent 4,536,518, which
covers sertraline per se and expires December 30, 2005. Zenith has also alleged
in its certification to the FDA that the manufacture, use and sale of Zenith's
product will not infringe Pfizer's U.S. Patent 4,962,128, which covers methods
of treating an anxiety-related disorder or Pfizer's U.S. Patent 5,248,699, which
covers a crystalline polymorph of sertraline hydrochloride. These patents expire
in November 2009 and August 2012, respectively. On January 28, 2000 the Company
filed a patent infringement action against Zenith Goldline and its parent Ivax
Corporation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
for infringement of the `128 and `699 patents.

FLUCONAZOLE PATENT

     On February 1, 2000 the Company received notice of the filing of an ANDA by
Novopharm Limited for 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg tablets of fluconazole
alleged to be bioequivalent to DIFLUCAN. Novopharm has certified to the FDA its
position that the Company's U.S. Patent 4,404,216, which covers fluconazole, is
invalid. This patent expires in January 2004. On March 10, 2000, the Company
filed a patent infringement action under the '216 patent against Novopharm in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

HYBRID CORN SEED LITIGATION

     In pre-existing litigation between Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. and
DeKalb Genetics Corporation in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Iowa, the court granted on October 8, 1999 Pioneer's motion to add
additional parties, including Pfizer Inc. and Monsanto Co. (the present owner of
DeKalb Genetics Corporation), as codefendant parties. The amended complaint,
which claims violations of the federal Lanham Act and Iowa state law stemming
from the codefendants' alleged use of Pioneer's corn seed germplasm in the
development of competitive corn seed products, was served on the Company on
October 19. The Company filed its answer on December 15, 1999.

TROVAN TRADEMARK

     On September 22, 1999, the jury in a trademark-infringement litigation
brought against the Company by Trovan Ltd. and Electronic Identification
Devices, Ltd. relating to use of the TROVAN mark for trovafloxacin issued a
verdict in favor of the plaintiffs with respect to liability, holding that the
Company had infringed Trovan Ltd.'s mark and had acted in bad faith. Following a
further damage trial, on October 12, 1999, the jury awarded Trovan Ltd. a total
of $143 million in damages, comprised of $5 million actual damages, $3 million
as a reasonable royalty and $135 million in punitive damages. The court held a
hearing on December 27, 1999, on whether to award the plaintiffs profits based
on the company's sales of TROVAN and, if so, the amount of same. On February 24,
2000, the court entered judgment on the jury verdict and enjoined the company's
use of the TROVAN mark effective October 16, 2000. The plaintiff's request to be
awarded the company's profits from TROVAN sales and for treble damages was
denied. The Company's motion for mistrial remains outstanding and will be
considered with additional post-trial motions to overturn the jury verdicts and
the damage award.

SHILEY INCORPORATED

     As previously disclosed, a number of lawsuits and claims have been brought
against the Company and Shiley Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary, alleging
either personal injury from fracture of 60 degree or 70 degree Shiley Convexo
Concave ("C/C") heart valves, or anxiety that properly functioning implanted
valves might fracture in the future, or personal injury from a prophylactic
replacement of a functioning valve.

     In an attempt to resolve all claims alleging anxiety that properly
functioning valves might fracture in the future, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement in January 1992 in Bowling v. Shiley, et al., a case
brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio,
that established a worldwide settlement class of people with C/C heart valves
and their spouses, except those who elected to exclude themselves. The
settlement provided for a Consultation Fund of $90 million, which was fixed by
the number of claims filed, from which valve recipients received payments that
are intended to cover their cost of consultation with cardiologists or other
health care providers with respect to their valves. The settlement agreement
established a second fund of at least $75 million to support C/C valve-related
research, including the development of techniques to identify valve recipients
who may have significant risk of fracture, and to cover the unreimbursed medical
expenses that valve recipients may incur for certain procedures related to the
valves. The Company's obligation as to coverage of these unreimbursed medical
expenses is not subject to any dollar limitation. Following a hearing on the
fairness of the settlement, it was approved by the court on August 19, 1992, and
all appeals have been exhausted.

     Generally, the plaintiffs in all of the pending heart valve litigations
seek money damages. Based on the experience of the Company in defending these
claims to date, including insurance proceeds and reserves, the Company is of the
opinion that these actions should not have a material adverse effect on the
financial position or the results of operations of the Company. Litigation
involving insurance coverage for the Company's heart valve liabilities has been
resolved.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The Company's operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign
environmental laws and regulations. Under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA" or
"Superfund"), the Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with respect to certain
waste sites with which the Company may have had direct or indirect involvement.
Similar designations have been made by some state environmental agencies under
applicable state Superfund laws. Such designations are made regardless of the
extent of the Company's involvement. There are also claims that the Company may
be a responsible party or participant with respect to several waste site matters
in foreign jurisdictions. Such claims have been made by the filing of a
complaint, the issuance of an administrative directive or order, or the issuance
of a notice or demand letter. These claims are in various stages of
administrative or judicial proceedings. They include demands for recovery of
past governmental costs and for future investigative or remedial actions. In
many cases, the dollar amount of the claim is not specified. In most cases,
claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same
recovery or other relief as was asserted against the Company. The Company is
currently participating in remedial action at a number of sites under federal,
state, local and foreign laws.

     To the extent possible with the limited amount of information available at
this time, the Company has evaluated its responsibility for costs and related
liability with respect to the above sites and is of the opinion that the
Company's liability with respect to these sites should not have a material
adverse effect on the financial position or the results of operations of

                                       23
<PAGE>

the Company. In arriving at this conclusion, the Company has considered, among
other things, the payments that have been made with respect to the sites in the
past; the factors, such as volume and relative toxicity, ordinarily applied to
allocate defense and remedial costs at such sites; the probable costs to be paid
by the other potentially responsible parties; total projected remedial costs for
a site, if known; existing technology; and the currently enacted laws and
regulations. The Company anticipates that a portion of these costs and related
liability will be covered by available insurance.

ASBESTOS MATTERS

     Through the early 1970s, Pfizer Inc. (Minerals Division) and Quigley
Company, Inc. ("Quigley"), a wholly owned subsidiary, sold a minimal amount of
one construction product and several refractory products containing some
asbestos. These sales were discontinued thereafter. Although these sales
represented a minor market share, the Company has been named as one of a number
of defendants in numerous lawsuits. These actions, and actions related to the
Company's sale of talc products in the past, claim personal injury resulting
from exposure to asbestos-containing products, and nearly all seek general and
punitive damages. In these actions, the Company or Quigley is typically one of a
number of defendants, and both are members of the Center for Claims Resolution
(the "CCR"), a joint defense organization of sixteen defendants that is
defending these claims. The Company and Quigley are responsible for varying
percentages of defense and liability payments for all members of the CCR. A
number of cases alleging property damage from asbestos-containing products
installed in buildings have also been brought against the Company, but most have
been resolved.

     As of January 29, 2000, there were 57,328 personal injury claims pending
against Quigley and 26,890 such claims against the Company (excluding those that
are inactive or have been settled in principle), and 68 talc cases against the
Company.

     The Company believes that its costs incurred in defending and ultimately
disposing of the asbestos personal injury claims, as well as the property damage
and talc claims, will be largely covered by insurance policies issued by several
primary insurance carriers and a number of excess carriers that have agreed to
provide coverage, subject to deductibles, exclusions, retentions and policy
limits. Litigation against excess insurance carriers seeking damages and/or
declaratory relief to secure their coverage obligations has now been largely
resolved, although claims against several of such insureds do remain pending.
Based on the Company's experience in defending the claims to date and the amount
of insurance coverage available, the Company is of the opinion that the actions
should not ultimately have a material adverse effect on the financial position
or the results of operations of the Company.

BRAND-NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ANTITRUST LITIGATION

     In 1993, the Company was named, together with numerous other manufacturers
of brand-name prescription drugs and certain companies that distribute
brand-name prescription drugs, in suits in federal and state courts brought by
various groups of retail pharmacy companies, alleging that the manufacturers
violated the Sherman Act by agreeing not to give retailers certain discounts and
that the failure to give such discounts violated the Robinson Patman Act. A
class action was brought on the Sherman Act claim, as well as additional actions
by approximately 3,500 individual retail pharmacies and a group of chain and
supermarket pharmacies (the "individual actions") on both the Sherman Act and
Robinson Patman Act claims. A retailer class was certified in 1994 (the "Federal
Class Action"). In 1996, fifteen manufacturer defendants, including the Company,
settled the Federal Class Action. The Company's share was $31.25 million,
payable in four annual installments without interest. Trial began in September
1998 for the class case against the non-settlers, and the District Court also
permitted the opt-out plaintiffs to add the


                                       24
<PAGE>

wholesalers as named defendants in their cases. The District Court dismissed the
case at the close of the plaintiffs' evidence. The plaintiffs appealed and, on
July 13, 1999, the Court of Appeals upheld most of the dismissal but remanded on
one issue, while expressing doubts that the plaintiffs could prove any damages.
The District Court has since opined that the plaintiffs cannot prove such
damages.

     Retail pharmacy cases also have been filed in state courts in five states,
and consumer class actions were filed in state courts in fourteen states and the
District of Columbia alleging injury to consumers from the failure to give
discounts to retail pharmacy companies.

     In addition to its settlement of the retailer Federal Class Action (see
above), the Company has also settled several major opt-out retail cases, and
along with other manufacturers: (1) has entered into an agreement to settle all
outstanding consumer class actions (except Alabama, California, New Mexico,
North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia), which settlement is going through
the approval process in the various courts in which the actions are pending; and
(2) has entered into an agreement to settle the California consumer case, which
has been approved by the Court there.

     The Company believes that these brand-name prescription drug antitrust
cases, which generally seek damages and certain injunctive relief, are without
merit.

     The Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation focusing on the
pricing practices at issue in the above pharmacy antitrust litigation. In July
1996, the Commission issued a subpoena for documents to the Company, among
others, to which the Company responded. A second subpoena was issued to the
Company for documents in May 1997 and the Company again responded. We are not
aware of any further activity.

PLAX

     FDA administrative proceedings relating to PLAX are pending, principally an
industry-wide call for data on all anti-plaque products by the FDA. The
call-for-data notice specified that products that have been marketed for a
material time and to a material extent may remain on the market pending FDA
review of the data, provided the manufacturer has a good faith belief that the
product is generally recognized as safe and effective and is not misbranded. The
Company believes that PLAX satisfied these requirements and prepared a response
to the FDA's request, which was filed on June 17, 1991. This filing, as well as
the filings of other manufacturers, is still under review and is currently being
considered by an FDA Advisory Committee. The Committee has issued a draft report
recommending that plaque removal claims should not be permitted in the absence
of data establishing efficacy against gingivitis. The process of incorporating
the Advisory Committee recommendations into a final monograph is expected to
take several years. If the draft recommendation is ultimately accepted in the
final monograph, although it would have a negative impact on sales of PLAX, it
will not have a material adverse effect on the sales, financial position or
operations of the Company.

     On January 15, 1997, an action was filed in Circuit Court, Chambers County,
Alabama, purportedly on behalf of a class of consumers, variously defined by the
laws or types of laws governing their rights and encompassing residents of up to
47 states. The complaint alleges that the Company's claims for PLAX were untrue,
entitling them to a refund of their purchase price for purchases since 1988. A
hearing on Plaintiffs' motion to certify the class was held on June 2, 1998. We
are awaiting the Court's decision. The Company believes the complaint is without
merit.

RID

         Since December 1998,  four actions have been filed,  in state courts in
Houston,  San  Francisco,  Chicago  and New  Orleans,  purportedly  on behalf of
statewide (California) or nationwide (Houston,  Chicago and New Orleans) classes
of consumers who allege that

                                       25
<PAGE>

the Company's and other manufacturers' advertising and promotional claims for
RID and other pediculicides were untrue, entitling them to refunds, other
damages and/or injunctive relief. The Houston case has been voluntarily
dismissed and proceedings in the San Francisco, Chicago and New Orleans cases
are still in early stages of the proceedings. The Company believes the
complaints are without merit.

DESITIN

     In December, 1999 and January, 2000, two suits were filed in California
state courts against the Company and other manufacturers of zinc
oxide-containing powders. The first suit was filed by the Center for
Environmental Health and the second was filed by an individual plaintiff on
behalf of a purported class of purchasers of baby powder products. The suits
generally allege that the label of DESITIN powder violates California's
"Proposition 65" by failing to warn of the presence of lead, which is alleged to
be a carcinogen. In January, 2000, the Company received a notice from a
California environmental group alleging that the labeling of DESITIN ointment
and powder violates Proposition 65 by failing to warn of the presence of
cadmium, which is alleged to be a carcinogen. Several other manufacturers of
zinc oxide-containing topical baby products have received similar notices. The
Company believes that the labeling for DESITIN complies with applicable legal
requirements.

FDA REQUIRED POST-MARKETING REPORTS

         In April  1996,  the  Company  received a Warning  Letter  from the FDA
relating to the timeliness and completeness of required  post-marketing  reports
for  pharmaceutical  products.  The letter did not raise any safety  issue about
Pfizer drugs.  The Company has been  implementing  remedial  actions designed to
remedy the issues  raised in the letter.  During 1997,  the Company met with the
FDA to apprise them of the scope and status of these activities. A review of the
Company's new  procedures  was undertaken by FDA in 1999. The Company and Agency
met to review  the  findings  of this  review and agreed  that  commitments  and
remedial  measures  undertaken by the Company related to the Warning Letter have
been  accomplished.  The  Company  agreed  to keep the  Agency  informed  of its
activities as it continues to modify its processes and procedures.

TROVAN

     During May and June, 1999, the FDA and the European Union's Committee for
Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) reconsidered the approvals to market
Trovan, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, following post-market reports of severe
adverse liver reactions to the drug. On June 9, the company announced that,
regarding the marketing of TROVAN in the United States, it had agreed to
restrict the indications, limit product distribution, make certain other
labeling changes and to communicate revised warnings to health care
professionals in the United States. On July 1, Pfizer received the opinion of
the CPMP recommending a one-year suspension of the licenses to market TROVAN in
the European Union. The CPMP opinion has been finalized in a Final Decision by
the European Commission. Since June, 1999, three suits and several claims have
been received by the Company alleging liver injuries due to the ingestion of
TROVAN. The majority of these claims have been resolved without litigation. In
June and July, 1999, two of the lawsuits were filed in the Circuit Court,
Hampton County, South Carolina on behalf of a purported class of all persons who
received TROVAN, seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive
relief. One of the suits, seeking injunctive relief, has been dismissed. No
substantive proceedings have yet occurred in the other suit and the Company
believes that it is not properly maintainable as a class action, and will defend
against it accordingly.

RIMADYL

     In October 1999 the Company was sued in an action seeking unspecified
damages, costs and attorney's fees on behalf of a purported class of people
whose dogs had suffered injury or death after ingesting RIMADYL, an
antiarthritic medication for older dogs. The suit, which was filed in state
court in South Carolina, is in the

                                       26
<PAGE>

early pretrial stages. The Company believes it is without merit.

MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY GROUP

     During 1998, the Company completed the sale of all of the businesses and
companies that were part of the Medical Technology Group. As part of the sale
provisions, the Company has retained responsibility for certain items, including
matters related to the sale of MTG products sold by the Company before the sale
of the MTG businesses. A number of cases have been brought against Howmedica
Inc. (some of which also name the Company) alleging that P.C.A. one-piece
acetabular hip prostheses sold from 1983 through 1990 were defectively designed
and manufactured and pose undisclosed risks to implantees. These cases have now
been resolved. Between 1994 and 1996, seven class actions alleging various
injuries arising from implantable penile prostheses manufactured by American
Medical Systems were filed and ultimately dismissed or discontinued. Thereafter,
between late 1996 and early 1998, approximately 700 former members of one or
more of the purported classes, represented by some of the same lawyers who filed
the class actions, filed individual suits in Circuit Court in Minneapolis
alleging damages from their use of implantable penile prostheses. Most of these
claims, along with a number of filed and unfiled claims from other
jurisdictions, have now been resolved. The Company believes that most if not all
of these cases are without merit.

DIABINESE (BRAZIL)

     In June, the Ministry of Justice of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil,
commenced a civil public action against the Company's Brazilian subsidiary,
Laboratorios Pfizer Ltda. ("Pfizer Brazil") asserting that during a period in
1991 Pfizer Brazil withheld sale of the pharmaceutical product DIABINESE in
violation of antitrust and consumer protection laws. The action sought the award
of moral, economic and personal damages to individuals and the payment to a
public reserve fund. In February 1996, the trial court issued a decision holding
Pfizer Brazil liable. The trial court's opinion also established the amount of
moral damages for individuals who might make claims later in the proceeding and
set out a formula for calculating the payment into the public reserve fund which
could have resulted in a sum of approximately $88 million. Pfizer Brazil
appealed this decision. In September 1999, the appeals court issued a ruling
upholding the trial court's decision as to liability. However, the appeals court
decision overturned the trial court's decision concerning damages, ruling that
criteria to apply in the calculation of damages, both as to individuals and as
to payment of any amounts to the reserve fund, should be established only in a
later stage of the proceeding. The Company believes that this action should not
have a material adverse effect on the financial position or the results of
operations of the Company.

                                   PFIZER INC.

                            STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLAN
                       ---------------------------------
                       (AS AMENDED THROUGH JULY 1, 1999)


1.   PURPOSE

     The purpose of the Stock and Incentive Plan (known as the "Stock Option and
Incentive  Plan of 1965 as  amended"  prior to the 1980  amendment  thereof  and
hereinafter  called the "Plan") is to furnish a material  incentive to employees
of the Company and its  subsidiaries by making available to them the benefits of
a larger  Common  Stock  ownership  in the  Company  through  stock  options and
otherwise.  It is believed that these increased  incentives will not only induce
the continued service of employees but will also stimulate their efforts towards
the continued success of the Company and its subsidiaries,  as well as assist in
the  recruitment of new employees.  Nothing in the Plan shall  interfere with or
limit in any way the right of the Company or any  subsidiary  to  terminate  any
participant's  employment at any time, nor confer upon any participant any right
to continue in the employ of the Company or any  subsidiary.  No employee  shall
have the right to be  selected  to receive an option or other  award  under this
Plan or having been so selected,  to be selected to receive a future award grant
or option.  Neither  the award nor any  benefits  arising out of this Plan shall
constitute part of a participant's  employment  contract with the Company or any
subsidiary  and,  accordingly,  this  Plan  and the  benefits  hereunder  may be
terminated  at any time in the  sole and  exclusive  discretion  of the  Company
without  giving rise to liability  on the part of the Company or any  subsidiary
for severance payments.

2.   ADMINISTRATION

     Except to the extent  otherwise  provided  in Section 4 and Section 15, the
Plan  shall  be  administered  by  the  Employee   Compensation  and  Management
Development   Committee,   which  shall  make,  in  its  sole  discretion,   all
determinations arising in the administration,  construction or interpretation of
the Plan  including  the right to construe  disputed or doubtful  Plan terms and
provisions,  and any such  determination  shall be conclusive and binding on all
persons, except as otherwise provided by law.

3.   TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES

     Subject to the  provisions  of Section  6(g),  the maximum  amount of stock
which may be issued under the Plan is 1,179,000,000*  shares of the Common Stock

which would  result in such  participant  receiving a grant of  incentive  stock
options for stock that would have an  aggregate  fair market  value in excess of
$100,000,  determined  as of the time that the option is granted,  that would be
exercisable for the first time by such participant  during any calendar year. No
option  with  respect to any shares  authorized  in 1975 shall be granted to the

shares authorized in 1975 are available therefor,  or with respect to any shares

authorized in 1972,  1975,  1980,  1983, 1986 or 1989 are available  therefor or
with  respect  to any  shares  authorized  in 1996  to the  extent  that  shares
authorized  in 1972,  1975,  1980,  1983,  1986,  1989,  or 1992  are  available
therefor,  or with respect to any shares  authorized  in 1999 to the extent that
shares  authorized in 1972,  1975,  1980,  1983,  1986,  1989, 1992, or 1996 are
available  therefor.  With respect to all options and stock awards granted on or
after  January 1, 1972,  the records of the Company  shall specify the number of

Committee as the Board of Directors may appoint,  shall make all  determinations

partly  in stock and  partly in cash and with  respect  to all  options  related
thereto.

6.   TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS

     All  options  under the Plan shall be subject  to the  following  terms and
conditions:

     (a)  Option  Price.  The option  price per share shall be not less than the
fair  market  value of the Common  Stock on the date the option is  granted,  as
determined  by the  Committee in accordance  with  applicable  provisions of the
Internal   Revenue  Code  and  Treasury   Department   rulings  and  regulations
thereunder.

     (b)  Number of  Shares.  The  option  shall  state the  number of shares of
Common Stock covered thereby.

     (c)  Payment.  At the time of the  exercise of the option the option  price
shall be payable in cash and/or, if the option so provides,  in shares of Common
Stock  valued  at the  market  price at the time the  option is  exercised.  The
Committee may in its discretion  require or permit  payroll  deductions or other
suitable means to enable  optionees to accumulate  sufficient  funds to exercise
their options and pay the option price.

     (d)  Term of Option.  An incentive stock option shall provide that it shall
not be  exercisable  after the expiration of ten years from the date such option
is granted. A non-qualified  option may be exercisable for a period greater than
ten years if so provided in the terms of the option.

     (e)  Exercise of Option.  No option may be exercised  during the first year
of its term or such longer  period as may be specified in the option;  provided,
however,  in the event of a "Change of Control" of the Company,  as that term is
defined in Section 11(e),  the Board may in its discretion make any options that
are not yet  exercisable  immediately  exercisable,  and  further  provided  the
Committee may in its  discretion  make any options that are not yet  exercisable
immediately  exercisable  in cases where (i) an  optionee's  employment is to be
terminated due to a divestiture or downsizing of a business, (ii) in the case of
a retiring optionee who holds options with extended vesting provisions, or (iii)
otherwise,  where the Committee  determines  that such action is  appropriate to
prevent inequities with respect to an optionee. Thereafter, an optionee, subject
to the terms of the option,  may  exercise the option in whole at any time or in
part from time to time either by giving written notice thereof  addressed to the
Treasurer of the Company,  or by using other  methods of notice as the Committee
shall adopt,  specifying the number of shares to be purchased and accompanied by
payment  of the  option  price  therefor.  In the  event of  death,  the  person
designated in the optionee's  Will, or in the absence of such  designation,  the
legal  representative  of an  optionee,  or if a  legal  representative  of  the
optionee has not been appointed,  the optionee's  surviving spouse,  may in like
manner  exercise the option provided the same was exercisable by the optionee at
the time of his death, but such privilege shall expire,  subject to Section 6(d)
and 6(f)  (iii)  hereof,  one year  after the death of the  optionee;  provided,
however,  in any event  that if the option is not  exercised  by the last day in
which it is exercisable,  the option shall be exercised and the proceeds paid to
the deceased optionee's estate.

                                       4
<PAGE>

     (f)  Termination of Option. The option, to the extent not exercised,  shall
terminate upon its expiration as set forth in Section 6(d) hereof, its surrender
as set forth in Section  11(c)  hereof,  or upon  breach by the  optionee of any
provision of the option,  or when the optionee  ceases to be an employee for any
reason  including  retirement,  whichever  event  shall first  occur;  provided,
however,  that with respect to options  granted  during and subsequent to August
1997 which are otherwise  exercisable in accordance  with Section 6(e) hereof on
the date of termination of employment, three months after the optionee ceases to
be an employee for any reason including  retirement,  however,  if the option so
provides,  the Committee in its  discretion  may permit the optionee to exercise
the option for  reasons  of  hardship  up to twelve  months  after  termination,
assuming that the option was otherwise exercisable; further except that, subject
to Section 6(d) hereof (i) the  optionee,  if his  employment is terminated as a
result of a disability,  and provided the option was  exercisable at the time of
termination of employment,  may elect to exercise the option, subject to Section
6(e) hereof,  within  twelve months after the date of  termination,  (ii) in the
event of his death while an employee,  the option shall terminate as provided in
Section 6(e) hereof, and (iii)  notwithstanding  subsections (i) and (ii) above,
if the option so  provides,  in the event that the  optionee  has  retired or is
eligible for retirement under Sections 4a., b. or d. of the Company's Retirement
Annuity  Plan,  or as the same may be  amended  from time to time,  or under any
pension or retirement plan maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
the optionee,  or in the event of death, the person designated in the optionee's
Will, or in the absence of such  designation,  the legal  representative of such
optionee,  or if a legal  representative of the optionee has not been appointed,
the optionee's  surviving  spouse,  may elect to exercise the option at any time
until such option expires by its terms; provided,  however, in any event that if
the  option is not  exercised  by the last day in which it is  exercisable,  the
option shall be  exercised  and the  proceeds  paid to the  deceased  optionee's
estate;  any  subsequent  reemployment  of the optionee by the Company shall not
affect  such  optionee's  right to  exercise  the  option  as  provided  in this
subsection (iii).

     (g)  Recapitalization.  In the event of any change in the number or kind of
outstanding   shares  of   Common   Stock  of  the   Company   by  reason  of  a
recapitalization,    merger,    consolidation,    reorganization,    separation,
liquidation,  stock split,  stock  dividend,  combination of shares or any other
change  in the  corporate  structure  or  shares  of  stock of the  Company,  an
appropriate adjustment will be made automatically, in accordance with applicable
provisions  of the Internal  Revenue Code and  Treasury  Department  rulings and
regulations  thereunder,  in the number and kind of shares for which options may
thereafter be granted both in the aggregate and as to each optionee,  as well as
in the number and kind of shares subject to options  theretofore granted and the
option price payable upon exercise of such options.

     (h)  Transferability.  The  option  shall  provide  that  it  will  not  be
transferable  by the  optionee  other  than by Will or the laws of  descent  and
distribution and shall be exercisable,  during the optionee's lifetime,  only by
him;  provided,  however,  that the  Committee in its  discretion  may grant (or
sanction  by way of an  amendment  to an  existing  grant)  non-qualified  stock
options which may be  transferred  by the  optionee,  solely as gifts during the
optionee's  lifetime,  to any member of the optionee's  immediate family or to a
trust  established  for the  exclusive  benefit  of one or more  members  of the
optionee's  immediate  family,  in which case the terms of such option  shall so
state. A transfer of an option  pursuant to this subjection may be effected only
by the Company at the written request of an optionee and shall become  effective
only when recorded in the Company's record of outstanding  options. In the event
an option is transferred as contemplated in this subsection, such option may not
be subsequently  transferred by the transferee other than by Will or the laws of
descent  and


                                       5
<PAGE>

distribution,  such option  shall  continue to be governed by and subject to the
terms and  conditions of this Plan and the relevant  grant,  and the  transferee
shall be entitled to the same rights as the optionee as if no transfer had taken
place.  As used in this  subsection,  "immediate  family" shall mean any spouse,
child,  stepchild or grandchild,  and shall include  relationships  arising from
legal adoption.

     (i)  Applicable  Law. The option shall contain a provision  that it may not
be  exercised  at a time when the  exercise  thereof or the  issuance  of shares
thereunder  would  constitute a violation of any federal or state law or listing
requirements  of the New York Stock Exchange for such shares.  The provisions of
the Plan shall be construed, regulated and administered according to the laws of
the State of New York without  giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws,
except to the extent superseded by any controlling Federal statute.

     (j)  Incorporation by Reference.  The option shall contain a provision that
all the  applicable  terms  and  conditions  of this  Plan are  incorporated  by
reference therein.

     (k)  Tandem  Award.  Any  option  constituting  a part  of a  tandem  award
authorized by Section 10 hereof shall be subject to the terms and  conditions of
such award.

     (l)  Other  Provisions.  The option shall  contain such  provisions  as the
Committee  shall deem advisable  consistent with the terms of the Plan as herein
set forth.  In addition,  the  incentive  stock options shall contain such other
provisions as may be necessary to meet the  requirements of the Internal Revenue
Code and the Treasury  Department rulings and regulations issued thereunder with
respect to incentive stock options.

7.   STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

     The Committee may, in its discretion,  grant stock  appreciation  rights to
the holder of any incentive stock option or  non-qualified  stock option granted
by the  Company.  Such  appreciation  rights  shall be subject to such terms and
conditions  consistent  with the Plan as the Committee shall impose from time to
time, including the following:

     (a)  An appreciation  right may be made part of any such option at the time
of its grant or at any time thereafter prior to its expiration;

     (b)  Upon exercise of an appreciation right the holder shall be entitled to
receive:

          (i)  a number of shares of the Common Stock of the Company  determined
               by dividing:

               (1) the  number of  shares  which the  optionee  selects,  not to
               exceed the total  number of shares that the  optionee is eligible
               to purchase  as of the  exercise  date under the related  option,
               multiplied by the amount,  if any, by which the fair market value
               of a share of the Common  Stock of the  Company  on the  exercise
               date exceeds the option price provided in the related option, by

               (2) the fair market  value of a share of the Common  Stock of the
               Company on the exercise date; provided,  however,  that the total
               number of shares  which


                                       6
<PAGE>

               may be received pursuant to the exercise of an appreciation right
               shall not  exceed  the total  number  of  shares  subject  to the
               related option; or

          (ii) if so  provided  in the award,  (a)  payment of cash equal to the
               aggregate  fair market value on the date of such  exercise of the
               number of shares of Common Stock  determined under clause (i); or
               (b) in part cash and in part  shares;  all as  determined  by the
               Committee in its sole discretion;

     (c)  No  fractional  share or cash in lieu  thereof will be issued upon the
exercise of any such right; and

     (d)  Exercise of an appreciation  right, in whole or in part, shall exhaust
and  terminate  the related  option with respect to the number of shares used in
the calculation under subsection  (b)(i)(1) of this Section 7 in determining the
number of shares issued upon such exercise of the  appreciation  right (or which
would  have been  issued but for any cash  payment).  Upon such  exercise  of an
appreciation  right, the number of shares subject to reallocation  under Section
13 shall be equal to the  difference  between  the number of shares  used in the
calculation  under  subsection  (b)(i)(1)  of this  Section 7 and the  number of
shares  issued to the  optionee  pursuant to such  exercise (or which would have
been issued but for any cash payment).

8.   STOCK AWARDS

     Stock awards will  consist of shares of Common Stock of the Company  issued
to participating  employees as additional compensation for their services to the
Company.  Stock  awards  shall be subject to the  provisions  of Section 3, this
Section  8,  Section  11(a),  (c) and (d) and,  during  the  period in which the
restrictions or the Company's right of reacquisition hereinafter referred to are
in effect,  Section 11(b).  Other than for stock awards determined in accordance
with the Company's Performance-Contingent Share Award Program and paid out under
this Plan, as to which there shall be no waiting  period,  each stock award to a
participant  shall  provide  that the  shares  subject  to such award may not be
transferred or otherwise  disposed of by the participant prior to the expiration
of a period or periods specified therein, which shall not occur earlier than one
year  following  the date of the award  (except  that the award may  permit  the
earlier lapse of such  restriction  in the event of the  participant's  death or
disability or retirement  pursuant to any pension or retirement  plan maintained
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries),  and that the Company shall have the
right to reacquire such shares upon termination of the participant's  employment
with the Company while such restriction is in effect,  such  reacquisition to be
upon the terms and conditions  provided in the award. Stock awards shall also be
subject to such other terms and conditions,  not inconsistent  therewith, as the
Committee determines to be appropriate.

9.   PERFORMANCE UNIT AWARDS

     Performance  unit  awards will  consist of  performance  units  credited to
participating  employees.  Each award shall  specify  the initial  value of each
performance unit, such value to be determined by reference to the book or market
value of the Common  Stock of the Company or to the  Company's  earnings or such
other  criteria  related to the Company's  performance as the Committee may deem


                                       7
<PAGE>

appropriate.  The award  shall be payable  in cash  and/or  Common  Stock of the
Company as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.

     Subject  to the  provisions  of  this  Section  9 and of  Section  11,  the
Committee  shall have  exclusive  authority  to determine  additional  terms and
conditions  of each  performance  unit  award.  Such  terms and  conditions  may
include, without limitation, provisions under which:

     (1)  On the payment date prescribed in the award a participant shall become
entitled to receive the full value of each such unit on such date, or such other
amount as such award may specify;

     (2)  Each unit may accrue earnings  determined by reference to earnings per
share or dividends paid per share on the Common Stock of the Company,  or to the
prime or another specified  lending rate, or to other criteria  specified in the
award and payable at such time or times as may be specified therein;

     (3)  The  right of a  participant  to  receive  payments  in  respect  of a
performance  unit  may be made  subject  in  whole  or in part to the  Company's
attainment of earnings or other objectives specified in the award; and

     (4)  The determination of all relevant  valuation and other data pertaining
to the award shall be in the sole judgment of the Committee.  Without limitation
of the foregoing,  in the event that an amount payable in respect of an award is
based in whole or in part on the  Company's  earnings  or the book  value of its
Common Stock, the Committee may make such  adjustments to the publicly  reported
amounts of the Company's consolidated earnings or of such book value as it deems
appropriate  for changes in  accounting  practices or  principles,  for material
acquisitions  or  dispositions of stock or property,  for  recapitalizations  or
reorganizations  or for any other  events  with  respect to which the  Committee
determines such an adjustment to be appropriate in order to avoid  distortion in
the operation of the Plan.

     Each award shall be evidenced by a written instrument which shall set forth
the number of  performance  units covered  thereby,  the initial dollar value of
each such unit,  the terms and  conditions,  if any,  under which such value may
change prior to the vesting of the unit,  the terms and  conditions  under which
each such unit will vest and such  other  matters as the  Committee  in its sole
discretion may deem  appropriate.  The Committee may from time to time establish
such rules as it deems  appropriate  regarding the manner and timing of payments
of amounts due in respect of vested units.

     No performance  unit award shall provide for the vesting in a participating
employee of any  performance  unit covered  thereby prior to the expiration of a
period  of one year  after  the date of the  award,  except  that the  award may
provide for such vesting in the event of death or  disability  or  retirement of
the employee  pursuant to a pension or retirement plan maintained by the Company
or one of its  subsidiaries  prior to the expiration of such period.  Each award
shall provide that prior to the vesting of the units covered  thereby they shall
be subject to forfeiture (A) upon the termination of the recipient's  employment
with the Company,  (B) as  contemplated  by Section 10 hereof,  if such award is
part of a tandem award, and (C) as may otherwise be specified in the award.

     No  participant  shall be entitled  to receive in respect of a  performance
unit payments of amounts exceeding twice the original value established for such
unit.

                                       8
<PAGE>

     The  maximum  dollar  value of  performance  units  which may be  initially
awarded  to  participants  may not  exceed  1,500,000  "Reference  Units" in the
aggregate  for  all  participants,  and  50,000  Reference  Units  for  any  one
participant. For purposes of this paragraph:

     (1)  A  Reference  Unit shall be the  equivalent  of the greater of (a) the
fair market value of one share of the Common Stock of the Company on the date as
of which a particular award of performance  units is made, or (b) the book value
of a share of such Common Stock as at the end of the last completed  fiscal year
of the Company prior to such award date plus the cash  dividends  paid per share
on such stock during such fiscal year; and

     (2)  Crediting of an award of performance units shall exhaust and terminate
a number of  Reference  Units  equal to the  number  obtained  by  dividing  the
credited  dollar value of such  performance  units by the greater of the amounts
referred to in subclauses (a) and (b) of Clause 1 above,  and except as provided
in the following sentence, such terminated Reference Units shall not be utilized
for subsequent awards.

     In the event that an award of  performance  units is  forfeited  or for any
other  reason the cash amount or the value of the shares of the Common  Stock of
the Company (as  determined  by the Committee in its sole  judgment)  ultimately
delivered to a participant in payment for an award of  performance  units (other
than amounts paid to the  participant as earnings on the  performance  units) is
less than the  Reference  Units  originally  exhausted and  terminated  upon the
crediting of such award, a number of Reference  Units equal to the dollar amount

Directors or a duly  appointed  committee  thereof to  authorize  the payment or
award  of  compensation  other  than in  stock to any  employee  otherwise  than
pursuant  to  the  Plan,  regardless  of the  fact  that a  particular  form  of
compensation  may be the same as or similar to that which the  Committee may pay
or award to participants under Section 9 of the Plan.

                RULES OF THE PFIZER INC STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLAN
                             FOR EMPLOYEES IN FRANCE


1.   INTRODUCTION

     The  Pfizer Inc Stock and  Incentive  Plan  (hereinafter  the "Plan" or the
"U.S. Plan") specifically authorizes the Committee to establish rules applicable
to options granted under the U.S. Plan,  including  options granted to employees
in France,  as the Committee deems advisable.  The Committee has determined that
it is advisable to  establish a sub-plan  for the  purposes of  permitting  such
options to qualify for  favorable  local tax and social  security  treatment  in
France.  Therefore,  the Company now establishes a sub-plan of the U.S. Plan for
the purpose of granting  options  which qualify for the favorable tax and social
security  treatment in France  applicable to options  granted under the Law n(0)
70-1322 of December 31, 1970, as subsequently  amended, to qualifying  employees
who are resident in France for French tax purposes.  The terms of the U.S. Plan,
of which this sub-plan is a part,  shall  constitute the Company's  stock option
plan for French  Employees  (the  "French  Plan").  Under the French  Plan,  the
qualifying employees will be granted only stock options. In no case will they be
granted  substitute  awards,  e.g.,  stock  bonuses,   restricted  stock,  stock
appreciation rights or other similar awards.

2.   DEFINITIONS

     Terms used in the French Plan shall have the same  meanings as set forth in
the U.S. Plan.

     In addition, the term "Option" shall have the following meaning:

     a.   Purchase options, that are rights to acquire shares repurchased by the
          Company prior to the grant of said options; or

     b.   Subscription  options,  that are  rights  to  subscribe  newly  issued
          shares.

     The term  "Grant  Date" shall be the date on which the  Committee  both (a)
designates the optionee and (b) specifies the terms and conditions of the Option
including the number of shares and the Option price.

     The term "Exercise  Eligibility  Date" shall mean the fifth  anniversary of
the Grant Date.

3.   ENTITLEMENT TO PARTICIPATE

     Any salaried employee or corporate executive in France shall be eligible to
receive options under the French Plan provided that he or she also satisfies the
eligibility  conditions  of the U.S.  Plan.  Options may not be issued under the
French Plan to employees or executives owning more


                                        1
<PAGE>

than ten percent (10%) of the Company's  capital shares or to individuals  other
than employees and corporate  executives of a French  subsidiary of the Company.
Options may not be issued to  directors of a French  subsidiary  unless they are
employed by such subsidiary.

4.   CONDITIONS OF THE OPTION/OPTION PRICE

     Notwithstanding  any  provision  in the  U.S.  Plan  to the  contrary,  the
conditions of the Options (option price, number of underlying shares and vesting
period)  will not be  modified  after the grant date,  except as provided  under
Section 6 of the French  Plan.  In this  respect,  Options will not be repriced,
re-granted, nor will the time at which Options may be exercised be accelerated.

     The option  price per share of common  stock  payable  pursuant  to options
issued  hereunder  shall be fixed by the  Committee  on the date the  option  is
granted,  but in no event  shall  the  option  price  per share be less than the
greater of:

     a.   with respect to purchase  options over the common stock, the higher of
          either 80% of the average  quotation price of such common stock during
          the 20 days of quotation  immediately  preceding the grant date or 80%
          of the  average  purchase  price  paid  for such  common  stock by the
          Company;

     b.   with respect to subscription options over the common stock, 80% of the
          average  quotation  price of such common  stock  during the 20 days of
          quotation immediately preceding the grant date; and

     c.   the minimum option exercise price permitted under the U.S. Plan.

5.   EXERCISE OF AN OPTION

     Upon  exercise  of an option,  the full  option  price will have to be paid
either by check or  credit  transfer.  The  optionee  may also give  irrevocable
instructions  to a  stockbroker  to  properly  deliver  the option  price to the
Company.

     The shares  acquired  upon  exercise  of an option  will be  recorded in an
account  in the name of the  shareholder,  or if the shares are held by a broker
after exercise, in an account in the name of the shareholder with the broker.

     No Option can be exercised before the Exercise  Eligibility Date.  However,
in the case of death of an optionee,  outstanding  options shall be  immediately
vested and exercisable under the conditions set forth by Section 7 of the French
Plan.

6.   CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION

     In  compliance  with  French  law,  the option  price shall not be modified
during the option's duration. Adjustments to the option exercise price or number
of shares  subject to an option issued  hereunder  shall be made to preclude the
dilution or enlargement of benefits under such option only in the case of one or
more of the following transactions by the Company:

                                        2
<PAGE>

     a.   an increase of corporate capital by cash contribution;

     b.   an issuance of convertible or exchangeable bonds;

     c.   a capitalization of retained earnings, profits, or issuance premiums;

     d.   a distribution of retained earnings by payment in cash or shares; and

     e.   a reduction of corporate capital by set off against losses.

7.   DEATH

     In the event of the death of a French optionee, said individual's heirs may
exercise the option  within six months  following  the death,  provided that any
option which remains  unexercised  shall expire six months following the date of
the optionee's death.

8.   INTERPRETATION

     It is intended that options granted under the French Plan shall qualify for
the  favorable  tax and social  security  treatment  applicable to stock options
granted  under the Law n(0)  70-1322  of  December  31,  1970,  as  subsequently
amended,  and in accordance with the relevant provisions set forth by French tax
law and the French  tax  administration.  The terms of the French  Plan shall be
interpreted accordingly and in accordance with the relevant provisions set forth
by French tax and  social  security  laws,  as well as the French tax and social
security administrations.

9.   AMENDMENTS

     Subject to the terms of the U.S. Plan, the Committee  reserves the right to
amend or terminate the French Plan at any time.

10.  ADOPTION

     The French Plan was adopted by the Board of  Directors  of the Company at a
meeting held on August 27, 1998.

                     SUMMARY OF PFIZER ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN

The Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") was established to provide a direct link
between pay and performance, thereby supporting increased overall Company
performance through increased individual performance. The purposes of the AIP
are to help motivate employees and attract and retain the highest quality
workforce.

Management selects AIP participants, including executive officers who are not
members of the Corporate Management Committee, and, in its discretion, sets the
bonus potential for each participant based on level of responsibility within the
Company. Annual incentive awards are based on an evaluation of either or both
individual and Company performance against quantitative and qualitative measures
and are subject to approval by senior management and, if appropriate, the
Employee Compensation and Management Development Committee or the Executive
Compensation Committee.

Amounts paid to employees constitute part of the employee's annual cash
compensation.

FINANCIAL REVIEW


Proposed Merger with Warner-Lambert Company

On February 7, 2000, we announced an agreement to merge with Warner-Lambert
Company (Warner-Lambert). Under terms of the merger agreement, which has been
approved by the Board of Directors of both Pfizer and Warner-Lambert, we will
exchange 2.75 shares of Pfizer voting common stock for each outstanding share of
Warner-Lambert voting common stock in a tax-free transaction valued at $98.31
per Warner-Lambert share, or an equity value of $90 billion based on the closing
price of our stock on February 4, 2000 of $35.75 per share. Customary and usual
provisions will be made for outstanding options and warrants.

     The combined company, which will be called Pfizer Inc, is expected to have
(excluding any impact of anticipated restructuring charges and transaction fees
of $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion):

   o compounded annual revenue growth of 13% and earnings growth of 25%
     through 2002

   o $4.7 billion in annual research and development expenses in 2000

   o anticipated annual cost savings and efficiencies of $1.6 billion by 2002
     ($200 million of these savings are expected to be achieved in 2000,
     $1 billion in 2001 and $1.6 billion in 2002)

   o diluted earnings per share of $.98 on a pro forma basis in 2000, $1.27 for
     2001 and $1.56 for 2002 (these numbers include the $1.6 billion of cost
     savings phased in over this time period, but do not include any increased
     sales from collaborative activities and the $1.8 billion termination fee
     paid by Warner-Lambert to American Home Products Corporation)

     This transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the use of
pooling-of-interests accounting, qualifying as a tax-free reorganization,
shareholder approval at both companies and usual regulatory approvals. The
transaction is expected to close in mid-2000.

     The  following  financial  review  reflects the results of  operations  and
financial  condition  of Pfizer and does not consider the impact of the proposed
merger with Warner-Lambert.

Overview of Consolidated Operating Results

In 1999, total revenues grew 20% to $16,204 million, reflecting the strong
worldwide demand for our in-line products, as well as our alliance products. Our
operating results in 1999 were impacted by the recording of a charge to write
off certain Trovan inventories. Our 1998 operating results reflect:

   o the sale of our Medical Technology Group (MTG)

   o the recording of certain significant charges associated with adjustments to
     asset values, the exiting of certain product lines, plant rationalizations,
     severance payments, co-promotion payments to Searle, a contribution to The
     Pfizer Foundation and other miscellaneous charges

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased 20% or $2,660 million in 1999 and 23% or $2,489 million
in 1998. Revenue increases in both years were primarily due to sales volume
growth of our in-line products and revenue generated from product alliances
(alliance revenue).

     Revenue growth in 1999 was not significantly impacted by foreign exchange.
Total revenues grew by 26% in 1998 excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

PHARMACEUTICAL revenues increased 22% to $14,859 million in 1999 and 26% to
$12,230 million in 1998. In the U.S. market, revenue growth was 21% in 1999 and
38% in 1998, while international growth was 22% in 1999 and 10% in 1998. The
introduction of Viagra accounts for 12 percentage points of the 1998 U.S.
growth. Pharmaceutical revenue growth in 1999 was not significantly impacted by
foreign exchange. In 1998, pharmaceutical revenue grew 29% excluding the impact
of foreign exchange. The currency impact on the 1998 revenue growth reflects the
strengthening of the dollar relative to the Japanese yen, as well as several
European and other Asian currencies.

     In 1999, we had seven products, including alliance products, with sales to
third parties in excess of $1 billion each. The five Pfizer-discovered products
in this group--Norvasc, Zoloft, Zithromax, Viagra and Diflucan--grew at a
combined annual rate of 18% in 1999 and are patent-protected well into this
decade, or beyond.

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR DATA HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR
PRESENTATION.

     In June 1999, the European Union's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal
Products suspended the European Union (EU) licenses of the oral and intravenous
formulations of our antibiotic Trovan for 12 months. In the rest of the world,
including the U.S., the use of Trovan is limited to serious infections in
institutionalized patients. As a result of these limitations, Trovan net sales
declined to $86 million in 1999 from $160 million in 1998. See "Cost of sales"
for a discussion of a charge recorded in 1999 to write off certain Trovan
inventories.


     Alliance revenue was $2,071 million in 1999, reflecting revenue associated
with the co-promotion of Lipitor, Aricept and our new alliance product,
Celebrex.

     In February 1999, we launched Celebrex with G.D. Searle & Co. (Searle), the
pharmaceutical division of Monsanto Company, which discovered and developed the
drug. Celebrex is used for the relief of symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis
and osteoarthritis. During 1999, Celebrex achieved total global sales of
approximately $1.5 billion.


                                                                              29
<PAGE>

PFIZER INC AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

     Together with our alliance partner, the Parke-Davis Division of
Warner-Lambert, the company that discovered and developed Lipitor, we co-promote
this product in most major world markets. During 1999, Lipitor achieved
third-party sales of approximately $3.7 billion.

     These alliances allow us to co-promote or license these products for sale
in certain countries. Under the co-promotion agreements, these products are
marketed and promoted with our alliance partners. We provide cash, staff and
other resources to sell, market, promote and further develop these products.
Revenue from co-promotion agreements is reported in the Statement of Income as
ALLIANCE REVENUE.

     Certain alliance agreements include additional provisions that enable our
product alliance partners the right to negotiate to co-promote certain specified
Pfizer-discovered products.


     Rebates under Medicaid and related state programs reduced revenues by $146
million in 1999, $150 million in 1998 and $99 million in 1997. The 1998 increase
in rebates reflects growth of in-line products and the introduction in 1998 of
two products--Trovan and Viagra. We also provided to the federal government
legislatively mandated discounts of $95 million in 1999, $105 million in 1998
and $88 million in 1997. Performance-based contracts also provide rebates to
several customers as a result of the increasing influence of managed care groups
on the pricing of our products.


     In the fourth quarter of 1999, we sold the Bain de Soleil sun care product
line for $26 million in cash to Schering-Plough HealthCare Products, Inc.
Proceeds from the sale approximated the total of the carrying value of net
assets associated with this product line and selling costs. The sale of Bain de
Soleil will not have a material impact on our future results of operations.


     ANIMAL HEALTH net sales increased 2% to $1,345 million in 1999 and
decreased 1% to $1,314 million in 1998. Excluding the impact of foreign
exchange, net sales increased 6% in 1999 and 3% in 1998. The increase in net
sales in 1999 was due to:

   o the performance of the companion animal business

   partially offset by

   o the continuing weakness in the livestock market in the U.S. and Europe

   o the decision of the European Commission to ban certain antibiotic feed
     additives, including Stafac (virginiamycin) in the EU after June 30, 1999

     We do not expect the ban on sales of virginiamycin to have a material
effect on our future results of operations.

     Sales of companion animal products increased by 30% in 1999 primarily due
to the launch of Revolution and the growth of Rimadyl. Revolution was approved
in the U.S. in July 1999 as the first and only topically applied medication for
dogs and cats that is effective against heartworm, fleas and many other
parasites. Rimadyl is a treatment for the relief of pain and inflammation
associated with osteoarthritis in dogs.


     Net sales decreased 1% in 1998 due to a weak livestock market in the U.S.
and poor Asian economies.

Product Developments

We continue to invest in R&D to provide future sources of revenue through the
development of new products, as well as through additional uses for existing
in-line and alliance products. Certain significant regulatory actions by, and
filings pending with, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) follow:

     Zoloft is the first and only medicine to receive FDA approval for the
treatment of PTSD.

     We have developed a comprehensive program to educate institutions and
health care professionals on the required in-hospital initiation and dosing
regimen for Tikosyn. We expect to launch Tikosyn in the U.S. in the first
quarter of 2000, and it will be available to those prescribers and hospitals
that have participated in this educational program.

     In October 1999, we received an approvable letter from the FDA for Relpax
for the treatment of migraines. Regulatory review is continuing in Europe.

     We received a non-approvable letter from the FDA for Zeldox in 1998.
Analysis and interpretation of the results of a recently completed study on the
effects of Zeldox will be included in an amended New Drug Application, which we
expect to file by midyear 2000.

     Ongoing or planned clinical trials for additional uses and dosage forms for
our currently marketed products include:

     Together with Warner-Lambert, we are jointly exploring potential Lipitor
line extensions and product combinations and other areas of mutual interest.
This includes a program to develop a combination product that contains the
cholesterol-lowering and antihypertensive medications in Lipitor and
Norvasc--two of the world's most widely prescribed medicines.


     Ongoing or planned clinical trials for new product development programs
include:

================================================================================

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lasofoxifene           Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis

================================================================================

     Additional product development programs are in various stages of discovery.

     In 1998, we entered into worldwide agreements with Aventis Pharma to
manufacture insulin and co-develop and co-promote inhaled insulin. Under the
agreements, Aventis Pharma and Pfizer will contribute expertise in the
development and production of insulin products, as well as selling and marketing
resources. We bring to the alliance our development of inhaled insulin from our
collaboration with Inhale Therapeutic Systems, Inc. Together with Aventis Pharma
we are building a new insulin manufacturing plant in Frankfurt, Germany, to
support the product currently in development.

     We have decided not to pursue further development of ezlopitant for the
treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients, as
well as Alond for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.

Costs and Expenses

In 1999, we substantially completed the actions under the restructuring plans
announced in 1998.

     In 1998, we recorded charges for the restructuring in addition to charges
for certain asset impairments. These pre-tax charges were recorded in the 1998
Statement of Income as follows:

================================================================================
(millions of dollars)         Total      COS*     SI&A*      R&D       OD*

================================================================================

     As a result of the restructuring, our workforce was reduced by
approximately 500 manufacturing, sales and corporate personnel. In 1998,
restructuring charges of $90 million are reflected in the pharmaceutical segment
and $87 million are in the animal health segment.

     In 1998, we recorded an impairment charge of $110 million in the
pharmaceutical segment to adjust intangible asset values, primarily goodwill and
trademarks, related to consumer health care product lines. These charges
resulted from significant changes in the marketplace and a revision of our
strategies.

     As noted in our discussion of revenues, our animal health antibiotic feed
additive Stafac was banned throughout the EU, resulting in 1998 asset impairment
charges of $103 million ($85 million to adjust intangible asset values,
primarily goodwill and trademarks, and $18 million to adjust the carrying value
of machinery and equipment in the pharmaceutical segment).

     In 1999, revenues declined approximately $41 million as a result of exiting
certain product lines. In 1999, as a result of the restructuring activities and
the asset impairments, we realized cost savings of approximately $39 million and
a reduction in amortization and depreciation expense of approximately $12
million.


     Cost of sales increased 21% in 1999 and 18% in 1998. Based on our
evaluation of the actions noted in our discussion of revenues, we determined
that it was unlikely that certain Trovan inventories of finished goods, bulk,
work-in-process and raw materials will be used. Accordingly, in the third
quarter of 1999, we recorded a charge of $310 million in COST OF SALES to write
off Trovan inventories in excess of the amount required to support expected
sales. Also included in COST OF SALES for 1999 is a benefit of $6.6 million
related to the change in accounting for the cost of inventories from the
"Last-in, first-out" method to the "First-in, first-out" method. Excluding the
Trovan inventory charge and the benefit related to the accounting change for
inventories in 1999 and the asset impairments and restructuring charges in 1998,
cost of sales increased 11%, comparable to the increase in 1999 net sales.

     Excluding the 1998 asset impairments and restructuring charges, cost of
sales increased 13% in 1998 as compared to an increase in net sales of 18%.


     SI&A increased 14% in 1999 and 27% in 1998. These increases reflect support
for previously introduced products and new products. Such support included
substantial global investments, begun in 1998, in our pharmaceutical sales
force, including the creation of a new U.S. primary-care sales force and a new
U.S. specialty sales force dedicated to rheumatology. In addition, personnel
increases in other specialty sales forces in the U.S. and the expansion of
international sales forces contributed to the increase in SI&A. Our past
investments in SI&A are enabling us to maximize the financial return realized
from our products.


     R&D increased 22% in 1999 and 26% in 1998. These expenditures were
necessary to support the advancement of potential drug candidates in all stages
of development (from initial discovery through final regulatory approval). In
2000, we expect total R&D spending to be about $3.2 billion. See "Proposed
Merger with Warner-Lambert Company" for the expected R&D spending in 2000 of a
combined Pfizer/Warner-Lambert entity.

     Other deductions--net decreased 90% in 1999 due to the absence of certain
significant charges recorded in 1998 of $883 million.

     Other deductions--net  increased  substantially in 1998 primarily due to:

   o asset impairments--$195 million

   o restructuring charges--$91 million

   o co-promotion payments to Searle for rights to Celebrex--$240 million

   o a contribution to The Pfizer Foundation-- $300 million

   o legal settlements involving the brand-name prescription drug antitrust
     litigation--$57 million

   partially offset by

   o an increase in interest income on the investment of cash generated from
     operations and the divestiture of MTG

   o foreign exchange effects

     Our overall effective tax rate was 28.1% in 1999 and 35.4% in 1998. This
decrease was due mainly to the 1998 gain on the disposal of MTG being recognized
in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.

     The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 28.0% in 1999 and
24.8% in 1998. Significant charges in both 1999 and 1998 were recorded in
jurisdictions with higher tax rates. However, the level of these charges was
greater in 1998 than in 1999. Excluding these charges in 1999 and 1998, the
effective tax rate was 28.4% in 1999 and 28.0% in 1998. This increase in 1999
was primarily due to the mix of income by country.

     We have received and are protesting assessments from the Belgian tax
authorities. For additional details, see note 9, "Taxes on Income," beginning on
page 49.

Discontinued Operations

In 1999, we agreed to pay a fine of $20 million to settle antitrust charges
involving our former Food Science Group. This charge is reflected in
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS--NET OF TAX. For additional details, see note 18,
"Litigation," beginning on page 54.

     During 1998, we exited the medical devices business with the sale of our
remaining MTG businesses:

   o Howmedica to Stryker Corporation in December for $1.65 billion in cash

   o Schneider to Boston Scientific Corporation in September for $2.1 billion in
     cash

   o American Medical Systems to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co., LLC, in September
     for $130 million in cash

   o Valleylab to U.S. Surgical Corporation in January for $425 million in cash

     The net proceeds from these divestitures were used for general corporate
purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Net income of
these businesses up to the date of their divestiture and divestiture gains are
included in DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS--NET OF TAX.

Net Income

Net income for 1999 decreased 5% from 1998. Diluted earnings per share were $.82
and decreased by 4% from 1998. Excluding the impact of the 1999 Trovan inventory
charge and certain significant charges and discontinued  operations in 1998, net
income increased by 29% in 1999 over 1998. On that same basis,  diluted earnings
per share were $.87 in 1999 and  increased  by 30% over 1998.  The 1998  pre-tax
significant charges related to:

   o asset impairments--$213 million

   o restructuring charges--$177 million

   o co-promotion payments to Searle--$240 million

   o contribution to The Pfizer Foundation--$300 million

   o other, which is primarily related to legal settlements--$126 million

     The decrease in working capital from 1998 to 1999 was primarily due to the
following:

   o Decrease in INVENTORIES--due to the writeoff of Trovan inventory

   o Increase in SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS--primarily to fund common stock purchases
     of $2.5 billion

offset by

   o Net increase in CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS and SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS--
     mainly from profits earned overseas

   o Increase in ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE--resulting from growth in sales volume and
     higher alliance revenue receivables due to sales growth of alliance
     products and the launch of Celebrex in February 1999

   o Decrease in INCOME TAXES PAYABLE

                                                                              33

PFIZER INC AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

The  increase  in working  capital  from 1997 to 1998 was  primarily  due to the
following:


   o Increase in CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS and SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS--due to
     the receipt of cash from the MTG divestiture

   o Increase in ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE--due to the alliance revenue receivables
     and growth in sales volume

   o Increase in INVENTORIES--due to higher pharmaceutical inventory levels as a
     result of new products

   offset by

   o Decrease in NET ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS--due to the sale of the
     MTG businesses

   o Increase in SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS--due to an increase in funding for common
     stock purchases at a higher average price net of repayments made with cash
     received from the MTG divestiture

   o Increase in DIVIDENDS PAYABLE--related to the first-quarter 1999 dividend
     declared in December 1998

   o Increase in INCOME TAXES PAYABLE--primarily due to changes in operations
     and the divestiture of the MTG businesses

   o Increase in OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES--primarily due to accrued charges
     associated with the divestiture of the MTG businesses and our plan to exit
     certain product lines

     The decline in the current ratio from 1998 to 1999 was primarily due to
higher short-term borrowings due to an increase in funding for common stock
purchases. The increase in shareholders' equity per common share in 1998 was
primarily due to growth in net income.

================================================================================

     Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 1999 primarily due
to:

   o higher receivable levels related to increased sales and alliance revenue

   o higher taxes paid

   reduced by

   o higher income from continuing operations


     Net cash provided by operating activities increased in 1998 primarily due
to:

   o higher taxes payable associated with sales growth of existing and new
     products as well as the MTG divestitures, partially offset by tax benefits
     associated with charges for asset impairment, restructuring, co-promotion
     payments to Searle and the contribution to The Pfizer Foundation

   o higher compensation related accruals

   reduced by

   o higher receivable and inventory levels related to new products


      Net cash used in investing activities in 1999 changed primarily due to:

   o the absence of proceeds from the sale of MTG which occurred in 1998

   o increased purchases of property, plant and equipment in 1999


   Net cash used in investing activities decreased in 1998 primarily due to:

   o proceeds from the sale of the MTG businesses, some of which accounts for
     our increase in short-term investments

   reduced by

   o increased long-term investments

   o increased purchases of property, plant and equipment


     Net cash used in financing activities decreased in 1999 primarily due to:

   o increased short-term borrowings for common stock purchases

   reduced by

   o higher dividend payments to our shareholders


     Net cash used in financing activities increased in 1998 primarily due to:

   o the increase in common stock purchases at a higher average price

   o higher dividend payments to our shareholders

   reduced by

   o more cash received from employee stock option exercises


     Under the current share-purchase program begun in September 1998, we are
authorized to purchase up to $5 billion of our common stock. In 1999, we
purchased approximately 65.6 million shares of our common stock in the open
market for approximately $2.5 billion. Since the beginning of this program, we
have purchased 80.4 million shares of our common stock for approximately $3
billion. In September 1998, we completed a program under which we purchased 79.2
million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $2 billion. Purchased
shares are available for general corporate purposes.

     We have available lines of credit and revolving-credit agreements with a
select group of banks and other financial intermediaries. Major unused lines of
credit totaled approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 1999.

                                                                              34

     Our short-term debt has been rated P1 by Moody's Investors Services
(Moody's) and A-1+ by Standard and Poor's (S&P). Also, our long-term debt has
been rated Aaa by Moody's and AAA by S&P for the past 14 years. Moody's and S&P
are the major corporate debt-rating organizations and these are their highest
ratings.

Dividends on Common Stock

Our dividend payout ratio, which represents cash dividends paid per common share
divided by diluted earnings per common share, was approximately 37% in 1999, 30%
in 1998 and 40% in 1997. In 1999, excluding the effect on net income of the
Trovan inventory charge, the dividend payout ratio was approximately 35%. In
1998, excluding the effects on net income of discontinued operations and charges
for asset impairment, restructuring, co-promotion payments to Searle and the
contribution to The Pfizer Foundation, the dividend payout ratio was 38%. In
December 1999, the Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2000 dividend of
$.09. The first-quarter 2000 cash dividend will mark the 33rd consecutive year
of quarterly dividend increases.

Banking Operation

Our international banking operation, Pfizer International Bank Europe (PIBE),
operates under a full banking license from the Central Bank of Ireland. The
results of its operations are included in OTHER DEDUCTIONS--NET.

     PIBE extends credit to financially strong borrowers, largely through U.S.
dollar loans made primarily for short and medium terms, with floating interest
rates. Generally, loans are made on an unsecured basis. When deemed appropriate,
guarantees and certain covenants may be obtained as a condition to the extension
of credit.

     To reduce credit risk, PIBE has established credit approval guidelines,
borrowing limits and monitoring procedures. Credit risk is further reduced
through an active policy of diversification with respect to borrower, industry
and geographic location. PIBE continues to have S&P's highest short-term rating
of A-1+.


     The net income of PIBE is affected by changes in market interest rates
because of repricing and maturity mismatches between its interest-sensitive
assets and liabilities. PIBE is currently asset sensitive (more assets than
liabilities repricing in a given period) and, therefore, we expect that in an
environment of increasing interest rates, net income would increase. PIBE's
asset and liability management reflects its liquidity, interest-rate outlook and
general market conditions.

     For additional details regarding our banking operation, see note 3,
"Financial Subsidiaries," beginning on page 44.


Forward-Looking Information and
Factors That May Affect Future Results

The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose
forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's
future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This annual report and
other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such
forward-looking statements that set out anticipated results based on
management's plans and assumptions. We have tried, wherever possible, to
identify such statements by using words such as "anticipate," "estimate,"
"expects," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes" and words and terms of
similar substance in connection with any discussion of future operating or
financial performance.

     We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized,
although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions.
Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate
assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or
should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary
materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear
this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements.

     We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

     Certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions are discussed here and under
the heading entitled "Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results" in Item
1 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999, which
will be filed at the end of March 2000.

     Prior to the filing of Form 10-K, you should refer to the discussion under
the same heading in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
October 3, 1999, and to the extent incorporated by reference therein, in our
Form 10-K filing for 1998. This discussion of potential risks and uncertainties
is by no means complete but is designed to highlight important factors that may
impact our outlook.

Competition and the Health Care Environment

In the U.S., many pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing
pressures, which could be significantly impacted by the current national debate
over Medicare reform.


                                                                              35

PFIZER INC AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

If the Medicare program provided outpatient pharmaceutical coverage for its
beneficiaries, the federal government, through its enormous purchasing power
under the program, could demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies that may
implicitly create price controls on prescription drugs. On the other hand, a
Medicare drug reimbursement provision may increase the volume of pharmaceutical
drug purchases, offsetting at least in part these potential price discounts. In
addition, managed care organizations, institutions and other government agencies
continue to seek price discounts. Government efforts to reduce Medicare and
Medicaid expenses are expected to increase the use of managed care
organizations. This may result in managed care influencing prescription
decisions for a larger segment of the population. International operations are
also subject to price and market regulations. As a result, it is expected that
pressures on pricing and operating results will continue.

Financial Risk Management

The overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek a
reduction in the potential negative earnings effects from changes in foreign
exchange and interest rates arising in our business activities. We manage these
financial exposures through operational means and by using various financial
instruments. These practices may change as economic conditions change.

Foreign Exchange Risk

A significant portion of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in
foreign exchange rates. Where practical, we seek to relate expected local
currency revenues with local currency costs and local currency assets with local
currency liabilities. Generally, we do not use financial instruments for trading
activities.

     Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency
forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential
earnings effects from short-term foreign currency assets and liabilities that
arise during operations. For additional details on foreign exchange exposures,
see note 4-D, "Derivative Financial Instruments--Instruments Outstanding," on
page 47.

     In addition, foreign currency put options are purchased to reduce a portion
of the potential negative effects on earnings related to certain of our
significant anticipated intercompany inventory purchases for up to one year.
These purchased options hedge Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.

     Also, under certain market conditions, we protect against possible declines
in the reported net assets of our subsidiaries in Japan and in countries that
are a member of the European Monetary Union. We do this through currency swaps
and borrowing in Japanese yen and borrowing in euros.

     Our financial instrument holdings at year-end were analyzed to determine
their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. The fair values of these
instruments were determined as follows:

   o forward-exchange contracts and currency swaps--net present values

   o purchased foreign currency options--foreign exchange option pricing model

   o foreign receivables, payables, debt and loans--changes in exchange rates

     In our sensitivity analysis, we assumed that the change in one currency's
rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not have an effect on other currencies'
rates relative to the U.S. dollar. All other factors were held constant.

     If there were an adverse change in foreign exchange rates of 10%, the
expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be
immaterial. For additional details, see note 4-D, "Derivative Financial
Instruments--Accounting Policies," on page 46.

Interest Rate Risk

Our U.S. dollar interest-bearing investments, loans and borrowings are subject
to interest rate risk. We invest and borrow primarily on a short-term or
variable-rate basis. We are also subject to interest rate risk on Japanese yen
and on euro short-term borrowings. Under certain market conditions, interest
rate swap contracts are used to adjust interest-sensitive assets and
liabilities.

     Our financial instrument holdings at year-end were analyzed to determine
their sensitivity to interest rate changes. The fair values of these instruments
were determined by net present values.

     In our sensitivity analysis, we used the same change in interest rate for
all maturities. All other factors were held constant. If interest rates
increased by 10%, the expected effect on net income related to our financial
instruments would be immaterial.

International Markets

Thirty-nine percent of our 1999 revenues arise from international operations and
we expect revenue and net income growth in 2000 to be impacted by changes in
foreign exchange rates.

     Revenues from Asia comprised approximately 11% of total revenues in 1999,
including 8% from Japan.

European Currency

A new European currency (euro) was introduced in January 1999 to replace the
separate currencies of 11 individual countries. The major changes during its
first year of existence have occurred in the banking and financial sectors. The
impact at the commercial and retail level has been limited but is expected to
increase during the next two years through December 31, 2001, when the separate
currencies will cease to exist. We are modifying systems and commercial
arrangements to deal with the new currency, including the availability of dual
currency processes to permit transactions to be denominated in the separate
currencies, as well as the euro. The cost of this effort is not expected to have
a material effect on our businesses or results of operations. We continue to
evaluate the economic and operational impact of the euro, including its impact
on competition, pricing and foreign currency exchange risks. There is no
guarantee, however, that all problems have been foreseen and corrected, or that
no material disruption will occur in our businesses.

Tax Legislation

Pursuant to the Small Jobs Protection Act of 1996 (the Act), Section 936 of the
Internal Revenue Code (the U.S. possessions corporation income tax credit) was
repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 1995. The Act allows us to
continue using the credit against the tax arising from manufacturing income
earned in a U.S. possession for an additional 10-year period. The amount of
manufacturing income eligible for the credit during this additional period is
subject to a cap based on income earned prior to 1996 in the U.S. possession.
This 10-year extension period does not apply to investment income earned in a
U.S. possession, the credit on which expired as of July 1, 1996. The Act does
not affect the amendments made to Section 936 by the 1993 Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act, which provided for a five-year phase-down of the U.S.
possession tax credit from 100% to 40%. In addition, the Act permitted the
extension of the R&D tax credit through June 30, 1998. In 1998, this credit was
again extended to June 30, 1999, and in 1999, it was further extended to June
30, 2004.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 137, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES--DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB
STATEMENT NO. 133. This pronouncement requires us to adopt SFAS No. 133,
ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, on January 1,
2001. SFAS No. 133 requires a company to recognize all derivative instruments as
assets or liabilities in its balance sheet and measure them at fair value. We do
not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 133 to have a material impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Year 2000

We have not experienced any operational problems as a result of Year 2000
issues, and Year 2000 had no material effect on our revenues. Although the
transition from 1999 to 2000 did not adversely impact our company, there can be
no assurances that we will not experience any negative effects or disruptions in
our businesses in the future as a result of Year 2000 issues.

     The total cost of our Year 2000 Program was $130 million, of which we
incurred $94 million in 1999, $31 million in 1998 and $5 million in 1997. These
costs were expensed as incurred, except for capitalizable hardware of
approximately $8 million in 1999, $4 million in 1998 and $1 million in 1997 and
were funded through operating cash flows. Such costs did not include normal
system upgrades and replacements. Immaterial costs may be incurred in 2000 to
address remaining non-critical Year 2000 issues.


Litigation, Tax and Environmental Matters

Claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries for various legal and
tax matters. In addition, our operations are subject to international, federal,
state and local environmental laws and regulations. It is possible that our cash
flows and results of operations could be affected by the one-time impact of the
resolution of these contingencies. We believe that the ultimate disposition of
these matters to the extent not previously provided for will not have a material
impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, except
where specifically commented on in note 18, "Litigation," beginning on page 54
and note 9, "Taxes on Income," beginning on page 49.


                                   ----------


Management's Report

We prepared and are  responsible  for the  financial  statements  that appear on
pages 39 to 61. These  financial  statements  are in conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting principles and, therefore, include amounts based on informed
judgments and estimates.  We also accept  responsibility  for the preparation of
other financial information that is included in this document.

     We have designed a system of internal control to:

   o safeguard the Company's assets,

   o ensure that transactions are properly authorized, and

   o provide reasonable assurance, at reasonable cost, of the integrity,
     objectivity and reliability of the financial information.

     An effective internal control system has inherent limitations no matter how
well designed and, therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation. The system is built on a business ethics
policy that requires all employees to maintain the highest ethical standards in
conducting Company affairs. Our system of internal control includes:

   o careful selection, training and development of financial managers,

   o an organizational structure that segregates responsibilities,

   o a communications program which ensures that the Company's policies and
     procedures are well understood throughout the organization, and

   o an extensive program of internal audits, with prompt follow-up, including
     reviews of separate operations and functions around the world.

                                                                              37

procedures performed and such other tests that they deemed necessary, including
their consideration of our internal control structure.

     We consider and take appropriate action on recommendations made by KPMG LLP
and our internal auditors. We believe that our system of internal control is
effective and adequate to accomplish the objectives discussed above.

Audit Committee's Report

The Audit Committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process on behalf
of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the
financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal
controls. In this context, the Committee has met and held discussions with
management and the independent auditors. Management represented to the Committee
that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and the Committee has reviewed
and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the
independent auditors. The Committee discussed with the independent auditors
matters required to be discussed by Statement of Auditing Standards No. 61
(Communication With Audit Committees). In addition, the Committee has discussed
with the independent auditors, the auditors' independence from the Company and
its management, including the matters in the written disclosures required by the
Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with Audit
Committees). The Committee discussed with the Company's internal and independent
auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Committee
meets with the internal and independent auditors, with and without management
present, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the
Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial
reporting. In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the
Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved,
that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999, for filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee and the Board also have
recommended, subject to shareholder approval, the selection of the Company's
independent auditors.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

[KPMG Logo]

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Pfizer Inc:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc and
subsidiary companies as of December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pfizer Inc
and subsidiary companies at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1 Significant Accounting Policies

A--Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the parent company and all
significant subsidiaries, including those operating outside the U.S. Balance
sheet amounts for the international operations are as of November 30 of each
year and income statement amounts are for the full-year periods ending on the
same date. Substantially all unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries
are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions
among our businesses have been eliminated. We made certain reclassifications to
the 1998 and 1997 financial statements to conform to the 1999 presentation.

     In preparing the financial statements, we must use some estimates and
assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. Estimates are used
when accounting for depreciation, amortization, employee benefits and asset
valuation allowances. We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ from estimated results, such as changes in the
health care environment, competition, foreign exchange and legislation.
"Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results,"
beginning on page 35, discusses these and other uncertainties.

B--Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of
deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when
purchased. If items meeting this definition are part of a larger investment
pool, we classify them as SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.

C--Inventories

We value inventories at cost or fair value, if lower. Cost is determined as
follows:

   o finished goods and work-in-process at average actual cost

   o raw materials and supplies at average or latest actual cost

     In 1999, we changed the method of determining the cost of all of our
remaining inventories previously on the "Last-in, first-out" (LIFO) method to
the "First-in, first-out" (FIFO) method. Those inventories consisted of U.S.
sourced pharmaceuticals and part of the animal health inventories. We believe
that the change in accounting for inventories from LIFO to FIFO is preferable
because inventory costs are stable and substantially unaffected by inflation.
The change in the method of inventory costing resulted in a pre-tax benefit of
$6.6 million included in COST OF SALES for 1999.


D--Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets include:

   o property, plant and equipment--These assets are recorded at original cost
     and increased by the cost of any significant improvements after purchase.
     We depreciate the cost evenly over the assets' estimated useful lives. For
     tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax
     laws.

   o goodwill--Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of
     acquired businesses and the fair value of their net assets when accounted
     for by the purchase method. We amortize goodwill evenly over periods not
     exceeding 40 years. The average amortization period is 37 years.

   o other intangible assets--Other intangible assets are included in OTHER
     ASSETS, DEFERRED TAXES AND DEFERRED CHARGES. We amortize these assets
     evenly over their estimated useful lives.

     We review long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations
using undiscounted cash flows. When necessary, we record charges for impairments
of long-lived assets for the amount by which the present value of future cash
flows exceeds the carrying value of these assets.

E--Foreign Currency Translation

     For most international operations, local currencies are considered their
functional currencies. We translate assets and liabilities to their U.S. dollar
equivalents at rates in effect at the balance sheet date and record translation
adjustments in SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. We translate Statement of Income accounts
at average rates for the period. Transaction adjustments are recorded in OTHER
DEDUCTIONS--NET.

     For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate the balance
sheet items as follows:

   o monetary items (that is, assets and liabilities that will be settled for
     cash) at rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with translation
     adjustments recorded in OTHER DEDUCTIONS--NET

   o non-monetary items at historical rates (that is, those rates in effect when
     the items were first recorded)

                                                                              43

PFIZER INC AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

F--Product Alliances

We have agreements to promote pharmaceutical products developed by other
companies. ALLIANCE REVENUE represents revenue recorded under these co-promotion
agreements and is derived from the sale of products. The revenue is earned when
our co-promotion partners ship the related goods and the sale is consummated
with a third party. Such revenue is based in most cases upon a percentage of our
co-promotion partners' net sales. SELLING, INFORMATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
EXPENSES in most cases includes other expenses for selling and marketing these
products.

     We have license agreements in certain foreign countries for these products.
When products are sold under license agreements, we record NET SALES instead of
ALLIANCE REVENUE and record related costs and expenses in the appropriate
caption in the Statement of Income.

G--Stock-Based Compensation

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, we elected to account for our
stock-based compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES.

     The exercise price of stock options  granted equals the market price on the
date of  grant.  In  general,  there is no  recorded  expense  related  to stock
options.

H--Advertising Expense

We record advertising expense as follows:

   o production costs as incurred

   o costs of radio time, television time and space in publications are deferred
     until the advertising first occurs

     Advertising expense totaled $1,310 million in 1999, $1,139 million in 1998,
and $898 million in 1997.

2 Discontinued Operations

In 1999,  we agreed to pay a fine of $20  million  to settle  antitrust  charges
involving  our former  Food  Science  Group,  divested in 1996.  For  additional
details, see note 18, "Litigation."

     In 1998,  we  completed  the sale of the  Medical  Technology  Group  (MTG)
segment.  Accordingly,  the consolidated  financial statements and related notes
reflect   the   results   of   operations    and   net   assets   of   the   MTG
businesses--Valleylab,  Schneider, American Medical Systems (AMS), Howmedica and
Strato/Infusaid--as discontinued operations. We completed the sales of:

   o Howmedica to Stryker Corporation in December for $1.65 billion in cash

   o Schneider to Boston Scientific Corporation in September for $2.1 billion in
     cash

   o AMS to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co., LLC in September for $130 million in
     cash

   o Valleylab to U.S. Surgical Corporation in January for $425 million in cash


     In 1997, we sold Strato/Infusaid to Horizon Medical Products and Arrow
International for $21 million in cash.

     The contractual net assets identified as part of the disposition of
Valleylab, Schneider, AMS and Howmedica are recorded as NET ASSETS OF
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS at December 31, 1997. The net cash flows of our
discontinued operations are reported as NET CASH (USED IN)/PROVIDED BY
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

     Net assets of discontinued operations consisted of the following:

B--Short-Term Borrowings

The  weighted  average   effective   interest  rate  on  short-term   borrowings
outstanding  at December 31 was 4.3% in 1999,  3.7% in 1998 and 2.9% in 1997. We
had  approximately  $1.5  billion  available  to borrow under lines of credit at
December 31, 1999.

     The floating-rate unsecured notes mature on various dates from 2001 to 2005
and bear interest at a defined variable rate based on the commercial paper
borrowing rate. The weighted average interest rate was 6.1% at December 31,
1999. These notes minimize credit risk on certain available-for-sale debt
securities that may be used to satisfy the notes at maturity. In September 1998,
we repaid $195 million of the outstanding floating-rate unsecured notes prior to
their scheduled maturity by using the proceeds from the issuance of short-term
commercial paper.

     Long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1999, matures as follows:

D--Derivative Financial Instruments

Purpose

"Forward-exchange contracts," "currency swaps" and "purchased currency options"
are used to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks. Also, "interest rate
swap" contracts are used to adjust interest rate exposures.

Accounting Policies

We consider derivative financial instruments to be "hedges" (that is, an offset
of foreign exchange and interest rate risks) when certain criteria are met.
Under hedge accounting for a purchased currency option, its impact on earnings
is deferred until the recognition of the underlying hedged item (inventory) in
earnings. We recognize the earnings impact of the other instruments during the
terms of the contracts, along with the earnings impact of the items they offset.

     Purchased currency options are recorded at cost and amortized evenly to
operations through the expected inventory delivery date. Gains at the
transaction date are included in the cost of the related inventory purchased.

     As interest rates change, we accrue the difference between the debt
interest rates recognized in the Statement of Income and the amounts payable to
or receivable from counterparties under interest rate swap contracts. Likewise,
amounts arising from currency swap contracts are accrued as exchange rates
change.

     The financial statements include the following items related to derivative
and other financial instruments serving as hedges or offsets:


     PREPAID EXPENSES AND TAXES includes:

       o purchased currency options


     OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES includes:

       o fair value of forward-exchange contracts

       o net amounts payable related to interest rate swap contracts


     OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES includes:

       o net amounts payable related to currency swap contracts


     ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE  EXPENSE includes changes in the:

       o foreign exchange translation of currency swaps and foreign debt

       o fair value of forward-exchange contracts for net investment hedges


     OTHER DEDUCTIONS--NET includes:

       o changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and changes in
         foreign currency assets and liabilities

       o payments under swap contracts to offset, primarily, interest expense
         or, to a lesser extent, net foreign exchange losses

       o amortization of discounts or premiums on currencies sold under
         forward-exchange contracts


     Our criteria to qualify for hedge accounting are:
     Foreign currency instruments must:

       o relate to a foreign currency asset, liability or an anticipated
         transaction that is probable and whose characteristics and terms have
         been identified

       o involve the same currency as the hedged item

       o reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on our
         operations


     Interest rate instruments must:

       o relate to an asset or a liability

       o change the character of the interest rate by converting a variable rate
         to a fixed rate or vice versa

various instruments we use:

================================================================================
* ON JANUARY 1, 1999, MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION WERE PERMITTED TO
USE THE NEW CURRENCY, THE EURO, OR THEIR OLD CURRENCY.

     The Japanese yen for U.S. dollar currency swaps require that we make
interim payments of a fixed rate of 1.1% on the Japanese yen payable and have
interim receipts of a variable rate based on a commercial paper rate on the U.S.
dollar receivable. These currency swaps replaced $625 million of Japanese yen
debt, which previously served as a hedge of our net investments in Japan, as
well as related interest rate swaps.

     The Japanese yen and Swiss franc interest rate swaps effectively fixed the
interest rate on floating rate debt as follows:

   o the Japanese yen debt at 1.4% in 1999, 1998 and 1997

   o the Swiss franc debt at 2.1% in 1997

     The floating interest rates were based on "LIBOR" rates related to the
contract currencies. In connection with the sale of the Schneider Swiss
subsidiary in 1998, we terminated the Swiss franc interest rate swap contracts
and ceased borrowing Swiss francs.

E--Fair Value

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
derivative and other financial instruments at the balance sheet date:

   o short-term financial instruments (cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
     payable, forward-exchange contracts, short-term investments and
     borrowings)--cost approximates fair value because of the short maturity
     period

   o loans--cost approximates fair value because of the short interest reset
     period

   o long-term investments, long-term debt, forward-exchange contracts and
     purchased currency options--fair value is based on market or dealer quotes

   o interest rate and currency swap agreements--fair value is based on
     estimated cost to terminate the agreements (taking into account broker
     quotes, current interest rates and the counterparties' creditworthiness)

     The differences between fair and carrying values of our derivative and
other financial instruments were not material at December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997, except for a difference of $230 million at December 31, 1999 for
available-for-sale equity securities.

F--Credit Risk

We periodically review the creditworthiness of counterparties to foreign
exchange and interest rate agreements and do not expect to incur a loss from
failure of any counterparties to perform under the agreements. In general, there
is no requirement for collateral from customers. There are no significant
concentrations of credit risk related to our financial instruments. No
individual counterparty credit exposure exceeded 10% of our consolidated
SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY at December 31, 1999.

6 Inventories

In June 1999, the European Union's Committee for Proprietary  Medicinal Products
suspended the European Union licenses of the oral and  intravenous  formulations
of Trovan for 12 months.  Based on our  evaluation  of these  events and related
matters,  we determined that it was unlikely that certain Trovan  inventories of
finished  goods,  bulk,  work-in-process,   and  raw  materials  will  be  used.
Accordingly,  in the third quarter of 1999, we recorded a charge of $310 million
($205 million  after-tax,  or $.05 after-tax per diluted share) in COST OF SALES
to write off  Trovan  inventories  in excess of the amount  required  to support
expected sales.

================================================================================

     These charges resulted from a review of our global operations to increase
efficiencies and return on assets, thereby resulting in plant and product line
rationalizations. In addition to the disposition of our MTG businesses, we
exited certain product lines including certain lines associated with our animal
health business and certain of our fermentation operations.

     We wrote off assets related to the product lines we exited, including
inventory, intangible assets--primarily goodwill--as well as certain buildings,
machinery and equipment which we do not plan to use or sell.

     As a result of the restructuring, our work force was reduced by
approximately 500 manufacturing, sales and corporate personnel. Employee
termination costs represent payments for severance, outplacement counseling
fees, medical and other benefits and a $5 million noncash charge for the
acceleration of nonvested employee stock options.

     Other restructuring charges consist of charges for inventory for product
lines we have exited--$12 million, contract termination payments--$9 million,
facility closure costs--$7 million and environmental remediation costs
associated with the disposal of certain facilities--$16 million.

     In 1998, we recorded an impairment charge of $110 million in the
pharmaceutical segment to adjust intangible asset values, primarily goodwill and
trademarks, related to consumer health care product lines. These charges
resulted from significant changes in the marketplace and a revision of our
strategies, including:

   o the decision to redeploy resources from personal care and minor brands to
     over-the-counter switches of prescription products

   o the withdrawal of one of our major over-the-counter products in Italy

   o an acquired product line which experienced declines in market share


     In 1998, our animal health antibiotic feed additive, Stafac, was banned,
effective in mid-1999, throughout the European Union, resulting in asset
impairment charges of $103 million ($85 million was to adjust intangible asset
values, primarily goodwill and trademarks, and $18 million was to adjust the
carrying value of machinery and equipment in the pharmaceutical segment).

     Amounts are reflected in the preceding tables based on the location of the
taxing authorities. As of December 31, 1999, we have not made a U.S. tax
provision of approximately $1.9 billion for approximately $8.2 billion of
unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. These earnings are
expected, for the most part, to be reinvested overseas.

     We operate a manufacturing subsidiary in Puerto Rico that benefits from a
Puerto Rican incentive grant in effect through the end of 2002. Under this
grant, we are partially exempt from income, property and municipal taxes. For
further information on U.S. taxation of Puerto Rican operations, see "Tax
Legislation" on page 37.

     Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between financial
statement accounting and tax accounting, known as "temporary differences." We
record the tax effect of these temporary differences as "deferred tax assets"
(generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future
periods) and "deferred tax liabilities" (generally items that we received a tax
deduction for, but have not yet been recorded in the Statement of Income).

     The tax effects of the major items recorded as deferred tax assets and
liabilities are:

     A valuation allowance is recorded because some items recorded as foreign
deferred tax assets may not be deductible or creditable. The "foreign tax credit
carryforwards" were generated from dividends paid or deemed to be paid by
subsidiaries to the parent company between 1997 and 1999. We can carry these
credits forward for five years from the year of actual payment and apply them to
certain U.S. tax liabilities.

     The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed and closed its audits of
our tax returns through 1992. The IRS completed its audits in January 2000 of
our tax returns for 1993 through 1995. We are awaiting the agent's final report
for those years. We do not expect any material adjustments to be proposed.

     In November 1994, Belgian tax authorities notified Pfizer Research and
Development Company N.V./S.A. (PRDCO), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
our company, of a proposed adjustment to the taxable income of PRDCO for fiscal
year 1992. The proposed adjustment arises from an assertion by the Belgian tax
authorities of jurisdiction with respect to income resulting primarily from
certain transfers of property by our non-Belgian subsidiaries to the Irish
branch of PRDCO. In January 1995, PRDCO received an assessment from the tax
authorities for additional taxes and interest of approximately $432 million and
$97 million, respectively, relating to these matters. In January 1996, PRDCO
received an assessment from the tax authorities, for fiscal year 1993, for
additional taxes and interest of approximately $86 million and $18 million,
respectively. The additional assessment arises from the same assertion by the
Belgian tax authorities of jurisdiction with respect to all income of the Irish
branch of PRDCO. Based upon the relevant facts regarding the Irish branch of
PRDCO and the provisions of the Belgian tax laws and the written opinions of
outside counsel, we believe that the assessments are without merit.

     We believe that our accrued tax liabilities are adequate for all years.

     An average increase of 6.9% in the cost of health care benefits was assumed
for 2000 and is projected to decrease over the next five years to 5.2% and to
then remain at that level.

     A 1% change in the medical trend rate assumed for postretirement benefits
would have the following effects at December 31, 1999:

     We have savings and investment plans for most employees in the U.S., Puerto
Rico, the U.K. and Ireland. Employees may contribute a portion of their salaries
to the plans and we match a portion of the employee contributions. Our
contributions were $50 million in 1999, $48 million in 1998 and $43 million in
1997.

11 Lease Commitments

We lease properties for use in our operations. In addition to rent, the leases
require us to pay directly for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating
expenses, or to pay higher rent when operating expenses increase. Rental
expense, net of sublease income, was $158 million in 1999, $131 million in 1998
and $127 million in 1997. This table shows future minimum rental commitments
under noncancellable leases at December 31, 1999:

12 Common Stock

We effected a three-for-one stock split of our common stock in the form of a
200% stock dividend in 1999 and a two-for-one split of our common stock in the
form of a 100% stock dividend in 1997. All share and per share information in
this report reflects both splits. Per share data may reflect rounding
adjustments as a result of the three-for-one split.

     Under the current share-purchase program begun in September 1998, we are
authorized to purchase up to $5 billion of our common stock. In 1999, we
purchased approximately 65.6 million shares of our common stock in the open
market at an average price of $38 per share. Since the beginning of this
program, we have purchased 80.4 million shares of our common stock for
approximately $3 billion. In September 1998, we completed a program under which
we purchased 79.2 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $2
billion. In 1998, we purchased approximately 57.8 million shares of our common
stock at an average price of $33 per share under these share-purchase programs.
Of the 57.8 million shares repurchased in 1998, 14.8 million shares were
repurchased under the share-purchase program which started in September 1998,
for a total cost of $525 million.


13 Preferred Stock Purchase Rights

Preferred Stock Purchase Rights have a scheduled term through October 2007,
although the term may be extended or the Rights may be redeemed prior to
expiration. One right was issued for each share of common stock issued by our
company. These rights are not exercisable unless certain change-in-control
events transpire, such as a person acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock or an
announcement of a tender offer for at least 30% of our stock. The rights are
evidenced by corresponding common stock certificates and automatically trade
with the common stock unless an event transpires that makes them exercisable. If
the rights become exercisable, separate certificates evidencing the rights will
be distributed and each right will entitle the holder to purchase a new series
of preferred stock at a defined price from our company. The preferred stock, in
addition to preferred dividend and liquidation rights, will entitle the holder
to vote with the company's common stock.

     The rights are redeemable by us at a fixed price until 10 days, or longer
as determined by the Board, after certain defined events, or at any time prior
to the expiration of the rights.

     We have reserved 3.0 million preferred shares to be issued pursuant to
these rights. No such shares have yet been issued. At the present time, the
rights have no dilutive effect on the earnings per common share calculation.


14 Employee Benefit Trusts

In 1993, we sold 120 million shares of treasury stock to the Pfizer Inc. Grantor
Trust in exchange for a $600 million note. The Trust was established primarily
to fund our employee benefit plans. In February 1999, the Trust transferred 10
million shares to us to satisfy the balance due on its note and contributed its
remaining 90 million shares to the newly established Pfizer Inc. Employee
Benefit Trust (EBT). The Grantor Trust was then dissolved and the shares of the
EBT will now be used to fund employee benefit plans. The Balance Sheet reflects
the fair value of the shares owned by the EBT as a reduction of SHAREHOLDERS'
EQUITY.

================================================================================


     Options to purchase 115 million shares were outstanding during 1999 but
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the
common shares.


16 Stock Option and Performance Awards

We may grant stock options to any employee, including officers, under our Stock
and Incentive Plan. Options are exercisable after five years or less, subject to
continuous employment and certain other conditions and expire 10 years after the
grant date. Once exercisable, the employee can purchase shares of our common
stock at the market price on the date we granted the option.

     The Plan also allows for stock appreciation rights, stock awards and
performance awards. In 1999, shareholders approved amendments to increase the
shares available in the Plan and to extend its term through 2008.

     The following table summarizes information concerning options outstanding
under the Plan at December 31, 1999:

     The Performance-Contingent Share Award Program was established effective in
1993 to provide executives and other key employees the right to earn common
stock awards. We determine the award payouts after the performance period ends,
based on specific performance criteria. Under the Program, up to 120 million
shares may be awarded. We awarded approximately 2,276,000 shares in 1999,
approximately 1,959,000 shares in 1998 and approximately 1,347,000 shares in
1997. At December 31, 1999, program participants had the right to earn up to
12.3 million additional shares. Compensation expense related to the Program was
$64 million in 1999, $202 million in 1998 and $74 million in 1997.

     We entered into two forward-purchase contracts in 1998 and on maturity they
were extended. These contracts offset the potential impact on net income of our
liability under the Program. At settlement date we will, at the option of the
counterparty to the contract, either receive our own stock or settle the
contracts for cash. Other contract terms are as follows:

18 Litigation

The Company is involved in a number of claims and litigations, including product
liability claims and litigations considered normal in the nature of its
businesses. These include suits involving various pharmaceutical and hospital
products that allege either reaction to or injury from use of the product. In
addition, from time to time the Company is involved in, or is the subject of,
various governmental or agency inquiries or investigations relating to its
businesses.

     In 1999, the Company pleaded guilty to one count of price fixing of sodium
erythorbate from July 1992 until December 1994, and one count of market
allocation of maltol from December 1989 until December 1995, and paid a total
fine of $20 million. The activities at issue involved the Company's former Food
Science Group, a division that manufactured food additives and that the Company
divested in 1996. The Department of Justice has stated that no further antitrust
charges will be brought against the Company relating to the former Food Science
Group, that no antitrust charges will be brought against any current director,
officer or employee of the Company for conduct related to the products of the
former Food Science Group, and that none of the Company's current directors,
officers or employees was aware of any aspect of the activity that gave rise to
the violations. Five purported class action suits involving these products have
been filed against the Company; two in California State Court, and three in New
York Federal Court. The Company does not believe that this plea and settlement,
or civil litigation involving these products, will have a material effect on its
business or results of operations.

     On June 9, 1997, the Company received notice of the filing of an
Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) by Mylan Pharmaceuticals for a
sustained-release nifedipine product asserted to be bioequivalent to Procardia
XL. Mylan's notice asserted that the proposed formulation does not infringe
relevant licensed Alza and Bayer patents and thus that approval of their ANDA
should be granted before patent expiration. On July 18, 1997, the Company,
together with Bayer AG and Bayer Corporation, filed a patent-infringement suit
against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Laboratories Inc. in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania with respect to
Mylan's ANDA. Suit was filed under Bayer AG's U.S. Patent No. 5,264,446,
licensed to the Company, relating to nifedipine of a specified particle size
range. Mylan has filed its answer denying infringement and a scheduling order
has been entered. On December 17, 1999, Mylan received final approval from the
FDA for its 30 mg. extended-release nifedipine tablet. On March 16, 1999, the
United States District Court granted Mylan's motion to file an amended answer
and antitrust counterclaims. All discovery on the antitrust counterclaims is
stayed pending resolution of the patent misuse claims. On March 29, 1999, Mylan
filed a motion for summary judgment based on an adverse decision against Bayer
in Bayer's litigation against Elan Pharmaceutical Research Corp. which involved
the same nifedipine particle size

patent. Discovery has been essentially completed and the parties dispositive
motions were filed by an extended deadline of July 19, 1999, including Pfizer
and Bayer's summary judgment motion seeking to dismiss Mylan's patent misuse
defenses and counterclaims. On December 13, 1999, Mylan filed its opposition to
plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment dismissing Mylan's patent misuse defense
and counterclaim, and Bayer and the Company filed their opposition to Mylan's
motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. The parties reply memoranda in
support of their motions were filed on December 28, 1999.

     On or about February 23, 1998, Bayer AG received notice that Biovail
Laboratories Incorporated had filed an ANDA for a sustained-release nifedipine
product asserted to be bioequivalent to one dosage strength (60 mg.) of
Procardia XL. The notice was subsequently received by the Company as well. The
notice asserts that the Biovail product does not infringe Bayer's U.S. Patent
No. 5,264,446. On March 26, 1998, the Company received notice of the filing of
an ANDA by Biovail Laboratories of a 30 mg. dosage formulation of nifedipine
alleged to be bioequivalent to Procardia XL. On April 2, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer
filed a patent-infringement action against Biovail, relating to their 60 mg.
nifedipine product, in the United States District Court for the District of
Puerto Rico. On May 6, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer filed a second patent infringement
action in Puerto Rico against Biovail under the same patent with respect to
Biovail's 30 mg. nifedipine product. These actions have been consolidated for
discovery and trial. On April 24, 1998, Biovail Laboratories Inc. brought suit
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania
against the Company and Bayer seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity of
and/or non-infringement of the 5,264,446 nifedipine patent as well as a finding
of violation of the antitrust laws. Biovail has also moved to transfer the
patent infringement actions from Puerto Rico to the Western District of
Pennsylvania. Pfizer has opposed this motion to transfer and on June 19, 1998,
moved to dismiss Biovail's declaratory judgment action and antitrust action in
the Western District of Pennsylvania, or in the alternative, to stay the action
pending the outcome of the infringement actions in Puerto Rico. On January 4,
1999, the District Court in Pennsylvania granted Pfizer's motion for a stay of
the antitrust action pending the outcome of the infringement actions in Puerto
Rico. On January 29, 1999, the District Court in Puerto Rico denied Biovail's
motion to transfer the patent infringement actions from Puerto Rico to the
Western District of Pennsylvania. On April 12, 1999, Biovail filed a motion for
summary judgment also based in part on the summary judgment motion granted to
Elan in the Bayer v. Elan litigation in the Northern District of Georgia. Pfizer
and Bayer's response was filed on April 26, 1999. On September 20, 1999, the
United States District Court in Puerto Rico denied Biovail's motion for summary
judgment without prejudice to their refiling after completion of discovery in
the Procardia XL patent-infringement litigation. The court set an expedited
discovery schedule with a deadline of December 30, 1999, to complete discovery
of parties and fact witnesses and February 29, 2000, to complete discovery of
expert witnesses. On December 20, 1999, the court extended the date to complete
fact discovery to January 28, 2000, and that of expert discovery to March 15,
2000. A status conference with the court is scheduled for March 17, 2000.

     On April 2, 1998, the Company received notice from Lek U.S.A. Inc. of its
filing of an ANDA for a 60 mg. formulation of nifedipine alleged to be
bioequivalent to Procardia XL. On May 14, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer commenced suit
against Lek for infringement of Bayer's U.S. Patent No. 5,264,446, as well as
for infringement of a second Bayer patent, No. 4,412,986 relating to
combinations of nifedipine with certain polymeric materials. On September 14,
1998, Lek was served with the summons and complaint. Plaintiffs amended the
complaint on November 10, 1998, limiting the action to infringement of U.S.
Patent 4,412,986. On January 19, 1999, Lek filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint alleging infringement of U.S. Patent 4,412,986. Pfizer responded to
this motion and oral argument has been held in abeyance pending a settlement
conference. In September 1999, a settlement agreement was entered into among the
parties staying this litigation until the expiration of U.S. Patent No.
4,412,986 on November 2, 2000.

     On February 10, 1999, the Company received a notice from Lek U.S.A. of its
filing of an ANDA for a 90 mg. formulation of nifedipine alleged to be
bioequivalent to Procardia XL. On March 25, 1999, Bayer and Pfizer commenced
suit against Lek for infringement of the same two Bayer patents originally
asserted against Lek's 60 mg. formulation. This case was also the subject of a
settlement conference. In September, 1999, a settlement agreement was entered
into among the parties staying this litigation until the expiration of U.S.
patent No. 4,412,986 on November 2, 2000.

     On November 9, 1998, Pfizer received an ANDA notice letter from Martec
Pharmaceutical, Inc. for generic versions (30 mg., 60 mg., 90 mg.) of Procardia
XL. On or about December 18, 1998, Pfizer received a new ANDA certification
letter stating that the ANDA had actually been filed in the name of Martec
Scientific, Inc. On December 23, 1998, Pfizer brought an action against Martec
Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Martec Scientific, Inc. in the Western District of
Missouri for infringement of Bayer's patent relating to nifedipine of a specific
particle size. On January 26, 1999, a second complaint was filed against Martec
Scientific in the Western District of Missouri based on Martec's new ANDA
certification letter. Martec filed its response to this complaint on February
26, 1999. A hearing to determine claim scope is scheduled for June 1, 2000.

     Pfizer filed suit on July 8, 1997, against the FDA in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking a declaratory judgment and
injunctive relief enjoining the FDA from processing Mylan's ANDA or any other
ANDA submission referencing Procardia XL that uses a different extended-release
mechanism. Pfizer's suit alleges that extended- release mechanisms that are not
identical to the osmotic pump mechanism of Procardia XL constitute different
dosage forms

                                                                              55

requiring the filing and approval of suitability petitions under the Food Drug
and Cosmetics Act before the FDA can accept an ANDA for filing. Mylan intervened
in Pfizer's suit. On March 31, 1998, the U.S. District Judge granted the
government's motion for summary judgment against the Company. On July 16, 1999,
the D.C. Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on the ground that since the FDA
had not approved any ANDA referencing Procardia XL that uses a different
extended-release mechanism than the osmotic pump mechanism of Procardia XL, it
was premature to maintain this action, stating that Pfizer has the right to
bring such an action if, and when, the FDA approves such an ANDA. Subsequent to
FDA's final approval of Mylan's ANDA, on December 18, 1999 Pfizer filed suit
against FDA in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.
The suit alleges that FDA unlawfully approved Mylan's 30 mg. extended release
product because FDA had not granted an ANDA suitability petition reflecting a
difference in dosage form from Procardia XL.

     On March 31, 1999, the Company received notice from TorPharm of its filing,
through its U.S. agent Apotex Corp., of an ANDA for 1 mg., 2 mg., 4 mg. and 8
mg. tablets alleged to be bioequivalent to Cardura (doxazosin mesylate). The
notice letter alleges that Pfizer's patent on doxazosin is invalid in view of
certain prior art references. Following a review of these allegations, suit was
filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
against TorPharm and Apotex Corp. on May 14, 1999. The defendants requested a
90-day period in which to file their answer. The request was granted and
TorPharm/Apotex's answer was filed by August 19, 1999. Discovery is in progress.
On June 2, 1999, FDA was notified that given the patent litigation and pursuant
to provisions of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA may not approve
the TorPharm application for thirty months from filing or resolution of the
litigation.

     On May 5, 1999, the Company filed an action against Sibia Neurosciences,
Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking a
declaratory judgment that two Sibia patents claiming reporter gene drug
screening assays are invalid, not infringed by the Company, and unenforceable
due to Sibia's misuse of its patent rights in seeking certain license terms. On
May 27, 1999, Sibia Neurosciences, Inc. filed an answer to the Company's
declaratory judgment action in which Sibia denies that a prior case or
controversy existed, but admits that a case or controversy does now exist
regarding at least one patent in suit, denies the invalidity, unenforceability
and non-infringement of the patents in suit, and asserts various jurisdictional
and equitable defenses, affirmative defenses, and lack of standing by the
Company to assert patent misuse. Sibia Neurosciences also filed a counterclaim
alleging willful infringement by the Company of one of the patents in suit. A
reply to that counterclaim denying Sibia's allegation has been filed. The
parties submitted a joint status report to the court on December 14, 1999, in
which the parties agreed to complete fact discovery by August 21, 2000, and
commence trial on January 8, 2001.

     On May 19, 1999, Abbott Laboratories filed an action against the Company in
the United States District Court of the Northern District of Illinois alleging
that the Company's use, sale or manufacture of trovafloxacin infringes Abbott's
United States Patent No. 4,616,019 claiming naphthyriding antibiotics and
seeking a permanent injunction and damages. An answer denying these allegations
was filed on June 9, 1999. Discovery is in progress.

     On December 17, 1999, the Company received notice of the filing of an ANDA
by Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals for 50 mg. and 100 mg. tablets of sertraline
hydrochloride alleged to be bioequivalent to Zoloft. Zenith has certified to the
FDA that it will not engage in the manufacture, use or sale of sertraline
hydrochloride until the expiration of Pfizer's U.S. Patent 4,536,518, which
covers sertraline per se and expires December 30, 2005. Zenith has also alleged
in its certification to the FDA that the manufacture, use and sale of Zenith's
product will not infringe Pfizer's U.S. Patent 4,962,128, which covers methods
of treating an anxiety-related disorder or Pfizer's U.S. Patent 5,248,699, which
covers a crystalline polymorph of sertraline hydrochloride. These patents expire
in November 2009 and August 2012, respectively. On January 28, 2000, the Company
filed a patent infringement action against Zenith Goldline and its parent Ivax
Corporation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
for infringement of the '128 and '699 patents.

     On February 1, 2000, the Company received notice of the filing of an ANDA
by Novopharm Limited for 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg tablets of fluconazole
alleged to be bioequivalent to DIFLUCAN. Novopharm has certified to the FDA its
position that the Company's U.S. Patent 4,404,216, which covers fluconazole, is
invalid. This patent expires in January 2004. The Company is evaluating
Novopharm's notice.

     In pre-existing litigation between Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. and
DeKalb Genetics Corporation in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Iowa, the court granted on October 8, 1999 Pioneer's motion to add
additional parties, including Pfizer Inc. and Monsanto Co. (the present owner of
DeKalb Genetics Corporation), as codefendant parties. The amended complaint,
which claims violations of the federal Lanham Act and Iowa state law stemming
from the codefendants' alleged use of Pioneer's corn seed germplasm in the
development of competitive corn seed products, was served on the Company on
October 19. The Company filed its answer on December 15, 1999.

     On September 22, 1999, the jury in a trademark-infringement litigation
brought against the Company by Trovan Ltd. and Electronic Identification
Devices, Ltd. relating to use of the TROVAN mark for trovafloxacin issued a
verdict in favor of the plaintiffs with respect to liability, holding that the
Company had infringed Trovan Ltd.'s mark and had acted in bad faith. Following a
further damage trial, on October 12, 1999, the jury awarded Trovan Ltd. a total
of $143 million in

damages, comprised of $5 million actual damages, $3 million as a reasonable
royalty and $135 million in punitive damages. The court held a hearing on
December 27, 1999, on whether to award the plaintiffs profits based on the
Company's sales of Trovan and, if so, the amount of same. The Company's motion
for mistrial remains outstanding.

     As previously disclosed, a number of lawsuits and claims have been brought
against the Company and Shiley Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary, alleging
either personal injury from fracture of 60 degree or 70 degree Shiley Convexo
Concave ("C/C") heart valves, or anxiety that properly functioning implanted
valves might fracture in the future, or personal injury from a prophylactic
replacement of a functioning valve.

     In an attempt to resolve all claims alleging anxiety that properly
functioning valves might fracture in the future, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement in January 1992 in Bowling v. Shiley, et al., a case
brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio,
that established a worldwide settlement class of people with C/C heart valves
and their spouses, except those who elected to exclude themselves. The
settlement provided for a Consultation Fund of $90 million, which was fixed by
the number of claims filed, from which valve recipients received payments that
are intended to cover their cost of consultation with cardiologists or other
health care providers with respect to their valves. The settlement agreement
established a second fund of at least $75 million to support C/C valve-related
research, including the development of techniques to identify valve recipients
who may have significant risk of fracture, and to cover the unreimbursed medical
expenses that valve recipients may incur for certain procedures related to the
valves. The Company's obligation as to coverage of these unreimbursed medical
expenses is not subject to any dollar limitation. Following a hearing on the
fairness of the settlement, it was approved by the court on August 19, 1992, and
all appeals have been exhausted.

     Generally, the plaintiffs in all of the pending heart valve litigations
seek money damages. Based on the experience of the Company in defending these
claims to date, including insurance proceeds and reserves, the Company is of the
opinion that these actions should not have a material adverse effect on the
financial position or the results of operations of the Company. Litigation
involving insurance coverage for the Company's heart valve liabilities has been
resolved.

     The Company's operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign
environmental laws and regulations. Under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA" or
"Superfund"), the Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with respect to certain
waste sites with which the Company may have had direct or indirect involvement.
Similar designations have been made by some state environmental agencies under
applicable state Superfund laws. Such designations are made regardless of the
extent of the Company's involvement. There are also claims that the Company may
be a responsible party or participant with respect to several waste site matters
in foreign jurisdictions. Such claims have been made by the filing of a
complaint, the issuance of an administrative directive or order, or the issuance
of a notice or demand letter. These claims are in various stages of
administrative or judicial proceedings. They include demands for recovery of
past governmental costs and for future investigative or remedial actions. In
many cases, the dollar amount of the claim is not specified. In most cases,
claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same
recovery or other relief as was asserted against the Company. The Company is
currently participating in remedial action at a number of sites under federal,
state, local and foreign laws.

     To the extent possible with the limited amount of information available at
this time, the Company has evaluated its responsibility for costs and related
liability with respect to the above sites and is of the opinion that the
Company's liability with respect to these sites should not have a material
adverse effect on the financial position or the results of operations of the
Company. In arriving at this conclusion, the Company has considered, among other
things, the payments that have been made with respect to the sites in the past;
the factors, such as volume and relative toxicity, ordinarily applied to
allocate defense and remedial costs at such sites; the probable costs to be paid
by the other potentially responsible parties; total projected remedial costs for
a site, if known; existing technology; and the currently enacted laws and
regulations. The Company anticipates that a portion of these costs and related
liability will be covered by available insurance.

     Through the early 1970s, Pfizer Inc. (Minerals Division) and Quigley
Company, Inc. ("Quigley"), a wholly owned subsidiary, sold a minimal amount of
one construction product and several refractory products containing some
asbestos. These sales were discontinued thereafter. Although these sales
represented a minor market share, the Company has been named as one of a number
of defendants in numerous lawsuits. These actions, and actions related to the
Company's sale of talc products in the past, claim personal injury resulting
from exposure to asbestos-containing products, and nearly all seek general and
punitive damages. In these actions, the Company or Quigley is typically one of a
number of defendants, and both are members of the Center for Claims Resolution
(the "CCR"), a joint defense organization of sixteen defendants that is
defending these claims. The Company and Quigley are responsible for varying
percentages of defense and liability payments for all members of the CCR. A
number of cases alleging property damage from asbestos-containing products
installed in buildings have also been brought against the Company, but most have
been resolved.

     As of January 29, 2000, there were 57,328 personal injury claims pending
against Quigley and 26,890 such claims against the Company (excluding those that
are inactive or have been settled in principle), and 68 talc cases against the
Company.

     The Company believes that its costs incurred in defending and ultimately
disposing of the asbestos personal injury claims,

                                       57

as well as the property damage and talc claims, will be largely covered by
insurance policies issued by several primary insurance carriers and a number of
excess carriers that have agreed to provide coverage, subject to deductibles,
exclusions, retentions and policy limits. Litigation against excess insurance
carriers seeking damages and/or declaratory relief to secure their coverage
obligations has now been largely resolved, although claims against several of
such insureds do remain pending. Based on the Company's experience in defending
the claims to date and the amount of insurance coverage available, the Company
is of the opinion that the actions should not ultimately have a material adverse
effect on the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.

     In 1993, the Company was named, together with numerous other manufacturers
of brand-name prescription drugs and certain companies that distribute
brand-name prescription drugs, in suits in federal and state courts brought by
various groups of retail pharmacy companies, alleging that the manufacturers
violated the Sherman Act by agreeing not to give retailers certain discounts and
that the failure to give such discounts violated the Robinson Patman Act. A
class action was brought on the Sherman Act claim, as well as additional actions
by approximately 3,500 individual retail pharmacies and a group of chain and
supermarket pharmacies (the "individual actions") on both the Sherman Act and
Robinson Patman Act claims. A retailer class was certified in 1994 (the "Federal
Class Action"). In 1996, fifteen manufacturer defendants, including the Company,
settled the Federal Class Action. The Company's share was $31.25 million,
payable in four annual installments without interest. Trial began in September
1998 for the class case against the non-settlers, and the District Court also
permitted the opt-out plaintiffs to add the wholesalers as named defendants in
their cases. The District Court dismissed the case at the close of the
plaintiffs' evidence. The plaintiffs appealed and, on July 13, 1999, the Court
of Appeals upheld most of the dismissal but remanded on one issue, while
expressing doubts that the plaintiffs could prove any damages.

     Retail pharmacy cases also have been filed in state courts in five states,
and consumer class actions were filed in state courts in fourteen states and the
District of Columbia alleging injury to consumers from the failure to give
discounts to retail pharmacy companies.

     In addition to its settlement of the retailer Federal Class Action (see
above), the Company has also settled several major opt-out retail cases, and
along with other manufacturers: (1) has entered into an agreement to settle all
outstanding consumer class actions (except Alabama, California and North
Dakota), which settlement is going through the approval process in the various
courts in which the actions are pending; and (2) has entered into an agreement
to settle the California consumer case, which has been approved by the Court
there.

     The Company believes that these brand-name prescription drug antitrust
cases, which generally seek damages and certain injunctive relief, are without
merit.

     The Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation focusing on the
pricing practices at issue in the above pharmacy antitrust litigation. In July
1996, the Commission issued a subpoena for documents to the Company, among
others, to which the Company responded. A second subpoena was issued to the
Company for documents in May 1997 and the Company again responded. We are not
aware of any further activity.

     FDA administrative proceedings relating to Plax are pending, principally an
industry-wide call for data on all anti-plaque products by the FDA. The
call-for-data notice specified that products that have been marketed for a
material time and to a material extent may remain on the market pending FDA
review of the data, provided the manufacturer has a good faith belief that the
product is generally recognized as safe and effective and is not misbranded. The
Company believes that Plax satisfied these requirements and prepared a response
to the FDA's request, which was filed on June 17, 1991. This filing, as well as
the filings of other manufacturers, is still under review and is currently being
considered by an FDA Advisory Committee. The Committee has issued a draft report
recommending that plaque removal claims should not be permitted in the absence
of data establishing efficacy against gingivitis. The process of incorporating
the Advisory Committee recommendations into a final monograph is expected to
take several years. If the draft recommendation is ultimately accepted in the
final monograph, although it would have a negative impact on sales of Plax, it
will not have a material adverse effect on the sales, financial position or
operations of the Company.

     On January 15, 1997, an action was filed in Circuit Court, Chambers County,
Alabama, purportedly on behalf of a class of consumers, variously defined by the
laws or types of laws governing their rights and encompassing residents of up to
47 states. The complaint alleges that the Company's claims for Plax were untrue,
entitling them to a refund of their purchase price for purchases since 1988. A
hearing on Plaintiffs' motion to certify the class was held on June 2, 1998. We
are awaiting the Court's decision. The Company believes the complaint is without
merit.

     Since December 1998, four actions have been filed, in state courts in
Houston, San Francisco, Chicago and New Orleans, purportedly on behalf of
statewide (California) or nationwide (Houston, Chicago and New Orleans) classes
of consumers who allege that the Company's and other manufacturers' advertising
and promotional claims for Rid and other pediculicides were untrue, entitling
them to refunds, other damages and/or injunctive relief. The Houston case has
been voluntarily dismissed and proceedings in the San Francisco, Chicago and New
Orleans cases are still in early stages of the proceedings. The Company believes
the complaints are without merit.

     In December, 1999 and January, 2000, two suits were filed in California
state courts against the Company and other manufacturers of zinc
oxide-containing powders. The first suit was filed by the Center for
Environmental Health and the second was filed by an individual plaintiff on
behalf of a

                                             PFIZER INC AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

purported class of purchasers of baby powder products. The suits generally
allege that the label of Desitin powder violates California's "Proposition 65"
by failing to warn of the presence of lead, which is alleged to be a carcinogen.
In January, 2000, the Company received a notice from a California environmental
group alleging that the labeling of Desitin ointment and powder violates
Proposition 65 by failing to warn of the presence of cadmium, which is alleged
to be a carcinogen. Several other manufacturers of zinc oxide-containing topical
baby products have received similar notices. The Company believes that the
labeling for Desitin complies with applicable legal requirements.

     In April 1996, the Company received a Warning Letter from the FDA relating
to the timeliness and completeness of required post-marketing reports for
pharmaceutical products. The letter did not raise any safety issue about Pfizer
drugs. The Company has been implementing remedial actions designed to remedy the
issues raised in the letter. During 1997, the Company met with the FDA to
apprise them of the scope and status of these activities. A review of the
Company's new procedures was undertaken by FDA in 1999. The Company and Agency
met to review the findings of this review and agreed that commitments and
remedial measures undertaken by the Company related to the Warning Letter have
been accomplished. The Company agreed to keep the Agency informed of its
activities as it continues to modify its processes and procedures.

     During May and June, 1999, the FDA and the European Union's Committee for
Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) reconsidered the approvals to market
Trovan, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, following post-market reports of severe
adverse liver reactions to the drug. On June 9, the Company announced that,
regarding the marketing of Trovan in the United States, it had agreed to
restrict the indications, limit product distribution, make certain other
labeling changes and to communicate revised warnings to health care
professionals in the United States. On July 1, Pfizer received the opinion of
the CPMP recommending a one-year suspension of the licenses to market Trovan in
the European Union. The CPMP opinion has been finalized in a Final Decision by
the European Commission. Since June, 1999, three suits and several claims have
been received by the Company alleging liver injuries due to the ingestion of
Trovan. The majority of these claims have been resolved without litigation. In
June and July, 1999, two of the lawsuits were filed in the Circuit Court,
Hampton County, South Carolina on behalf of a purported class of all persons who
received Trovan, seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive
relief. One of the suits, seeking injunctive relief, has been dismissed. No
substantive proceedings have yet occurred in the other suit and the Company
believes that it is not properly maintainable as a class action, and will defend
against it accordingly.

     In October 1999 the Company was sued in an action seeking unspecified
damages, costs and attorney's fees on behalf of a purported class of people
whose dogs had suffered injury or death after ingesting Rimadyl, an
antiarthritic medication for older dogs. The suit, which was filed in state
court in South Carolina, is in the early pretrial stages. The Company believes
it is without merit.

     During 1998, the Company completed the sale of all of the businesses and
companies that were part of the Medical Technology Group. As part of the sale
provisions, the Company has retained responsibility for certain items, including
matters related to the sale of MTG products sold by the Company before the sale
of the MTG businesses. A number of cases have been brought against Howmedica
Inc. (some of which also name the Company) alleging that P.C.A. one-piece
acetabular hip prostheses sold from 1983 through 1990 were defectively designed
and manufactured and pose undisclosed risks to implantees. These cases have now
been resolved. Between 1994 and 1996, seven class actions alleging various
injuries arising from implantable penile prostheses manufactured by American
Medical Systems were filed and ultimately dismissed or discontinued. Thereafter,
between late 1996 and early 1998, approximately 700 former members of one or
more of the purported classes, represented by some of the same lawyers who filed
the class actions, filed individual suits in Circuit Court in Minneapolis
alleging damages from their use of implantable penile prostheses. Most of these
claims, along with a number of filed and unfiled claims from other
jurisdictions, have now been resolved. The Company believes that most if not all
of these cases are without merit.

     In June 1993, the Ministry of Justice of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil,
commenced a civil public action against the Company's Brazilian subsidiary,
Laboratorios Pfizer Ltda. ("Pfizer Brazil") asserting that during a period in
1991 Pfizer Brazil withheld sale of the pharmaceutical product Diabinese in
violation of antitrust and consumer protection laws. The action sought the award
of moral, economic and personal damages to individuals and the payment to a
public reserve fund. In February 1996, the trial court issued a decision holding
Pfizer Brazil liable. The trial court's opinion also established the amount of
moral damages for individuals who might make claims later in the proceeding and
set out a formula for calculating the payment into the public reserve fund which
could have resulted in a sum of approximately $88 million. Pfizer Brazil
appealed this decision. In September 1999, the appeals court issued a ruling
upholding the trial court's decision as to liability. However, the appeals court
decision overturned the trial court's decision concerning damages, ruling that
criteria to apply in the calculation of damages, both as to individuals and as
to payment of any amounts to the reserve fund, should be established only in a
later stage of the proceeding. The Company believes that this action should not
have a material adverse effect on the financial position or the results of
operations of the Company.

                                                                              59

19 Segment Information and Geographic Data

We operate in the following two business segments:

   o pharmaceutical--including treatments for heart diseases, infectious
     diseases, central nervous system disorders, diabetes, arthritis, erectile
     dysfunction and allergies, as well as self-medications

   o animal health--products for food animals and companion animals, including
     antibiotics, vaccines and other veterinary items


     Each separately managed segment offers different products requiring
different marketing and distribution strategies.

     We sell our products primarily to customers in the wholesale sector. In
1999, sales to our two largest wholesalers accounted for 14% and 12% of total
revenues. These sales were concentrated in the pharmaceutical segment.

     Revenues were in excess of $100 million in each of 12 countries outside the
U.S. in 1999. The U.S. was the only country to contribute more than 10% to total
revenues. The following tables present segment and geographic information:

20 Subsequent Event

On February 7, 2000, we announced an agreement to merge with Warner-Lambert
Company (Warner-Lambert). Under terms of the merger agreement, which has been
approved by the Board of Directors of both Pfizer and Warner-Lambert, we will
exchange 2.75 shares of Pfizer voting common stock for each outstanding share of
Warner-Lambert voting common stock in a tax-free transaction valued at $98.31
per Warner- Lambert share, or an equity value of $90 billion based on the
closing price of our stock on February 4, 2000 of $35.75 per share. Customary
and usual provisions will be made for outstanding options and warrants.

     This transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the use of
pooling-of-interests accounting, qualifying as a tax-free reorganization,
shareholder approval at both companies and usual regulatory approvals. The
transaction is expected to close in mid-2000.
