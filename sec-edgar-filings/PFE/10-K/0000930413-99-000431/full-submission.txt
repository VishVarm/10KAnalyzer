                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Pfizer Inc. (the COMPANY, which may be referred to as WE, US, or OUR) is a 
research-based, global pharmaceutical company. We discover, develop, manufacture
and market innovative medicines for humans and animals.

     Our home page on the Internet is at www.pfizer.com. You can learn about us
by visiting that site.

RECENT DEVELOPMENT

     In 1998, we exited the medical device business with the sale of our
remaining Medical Technology Group businesses:

o        Valleylab to U.S. Surgical Corporation
o        Schneider to Boston Scientific Corporation
o        American Medical Systems to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co., LLC
o        Howmedica to Stryker Corporation

         Refer to Note 2 to our financial statements, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS,
on page 45 in our 1998 Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference.

     NOTE THAT THROUGHOUT THIS 10-K REPORT, WE "INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE"
CERTAIN INFORMATION IN PARTS OF OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). THE SEC ALLOWS US TO DISCLOSE IMPORTANT INFORMATION
BY REFERRING TO IT IN THAT MANNER. PLEASE REFER TO SUCH INFORMATION.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

     We operate in two business segments:

o    PHARMACEUTICAL, which includes prescription pharmaceuticals for treating
     cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, central nervous system
     disorders, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, allergies, arthritis and other
     disorders, as well as non-prescription self-medications, and;

o    ANIMAL HEALTH, which includes antiparasitic, anti-infective and
     anti-inflammatory medicines, and vaccines for livestock, poultry and
     companion animals.

     These businesses derive synergies in certain research and regulatory
matters, but each requires different marketing and distribution strategies.
Comparative segment revenues, profits and related financial information for
1998, 1997 and 1996 are given in the table entitled SEGMENT INFORMATION on page
60 of our 1998 Annual Report. A table captioned PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN TOTAL
REVENUES and a graph captioned TOTAL REVENUES BY BUSINESS SEGMENT on pages 28
and 29 of the Annual Report give segment information over the past three years.
The information from those sections of the Annual Report is considered to be
incorporated in this 1998 10-K report.

     Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries where we
operate. In the U.S., the main regulatory authority we deal with is the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of the
products we offer, our research quality, our manufacturing processes and our
promotion and advertising. Similar government authorities act in most other
countries, and in many cases also regulate our prices. See GOVERNMENT REGULATION
AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS, below.

PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT

     Our Pharmaceutical segment is comprised of the Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Group
and the Consumer Health Care Group.

PFIZER PHARMACEUTICALS GROUP

     In 1997, we combined our U.S. and international pharmaceutical operations
into a consolidated Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Group. 

     Most of our pharmaceutical sales come from products in three major
therapeutic classes: cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases and central
nervous system disorders. We also have products for treatment of diabetes,
erectile




<PAGE>

dysfunction, allergies and arthritis. In 1998, prescription pharmaceuticals
contributed 87% of our revenues, as compared to 84% in 1997 and 83% in 1996.
1998 sales of our major pharmaceutical products - NORVASC, PROCARDIA XL,
CARDURA, ZITHROMAX, DIFLUCAN, TROVAN, ZOLOFT, VIAGRA, GLUCOTROL XL and ZYRTEC -
comprised 69% of our revenues. A table captioned NET SALES - MAJOR
PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS on page 29 of the Annual Report is incorporated by
reference.

     Cardiovascular disease products that treat problems affecting the heart and
the blood circulatory system are our largest therapeutic product line,
accounting for roughly 31% of our revenues. NORVASC, our largest-selling
product, is a once-a-day medication for hypertension (high blood pressure) and
angina (heart pain). It belongs to the class of drugs known as CALCIUM CHANNEL
BLOCKERS. It is the largest-selling high blood pressure medicine in the world.
Our other cardiovascular products include PROCARDIA XL, also a once-a-day
calcium channel blocker for hypertension and angina, and CARDURA, which is in
the ALPHA BLOCKER class of medications, and is used to treat hypertension and
benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate gland). Sales of PROCARDIA XL
continued to decrease during 1998, in part due to the medical community's
increased emphasis on NORVASC.

     We participated in the 1997 launch of LIPITOR, for treatment of high lipids
(cholesterol and triglycerides) in the bloodstream, under copromotion and
license arrangements with the Parke-Davis Division of Warner-Lambert Company,
which discovered the drug. Following its introduction, LIPITOR surpassed several
established competitors and, at the end of 1998, is the most-prescribed medicine
in its category in the U.S. At the end of 1998, LIPITOR was being sold in most
major world markets.

     In the infectious disease medicine category, our major products are
ZITHROMAX, DIFLUCAN and TROVAN. ZITHROMAX is an oral or injectable antibiotic in
the chemical class known as AZALIDES. In 1998, it was the most prescribed
brand-name oral antibiotic in the U.S in both the adult oral solid and the
pediatric liquid suspension categories. Sales of ZITHROMAX increased in 1998 in
part due to the increasing recognition by physicians of the product's
effectiveness in treating a broad array of infections. DIFLUCAN is used to treat
various fungal infections, including vaginal infections and certain infections
that afflict AIDS and cancer patients with weakened immune systems. In 1998 we
launched TROVAN, a once-daily oral dose antibiotic also available in intravenous
form. It belongs to the class of chemical compounds known as QUINOLONES, and
treats a broad range of infections. TROVAN's profile complements that of
ZITHROMAX.

     For treatment of central nervous system disorders, we offer ZOLOFT and
participate in the promotion of ARICEPT. ZOLOFT is used for treatment of
depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder. It is our
second-largest selling product. Sales grew in 1998 in part from recent approvals
for its use to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder as well as
from increased field-force support. We participated in the 1997 launch of
ARICEPT for treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. ARICEPT
substantially expanded the prior market for pharmaceutical treatment of that
disease. The drug was discovered and developed by Eisai Co., Ltd., a Japanese
company, which contracted with us to license and copromote the product. It is
now sold in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and several other countries. ARICEPT
accounts for 97.1% of all Alzheimer's disease prescription drug sales in the
U.S. and has increased the number of new prescriptions in this category more
than fivefold.

     In 1998, we introduced VIAGRA, our oral medication for the treatment of
erectile dysfunction. Since its introduction in the U.S. in April, more than
200,000 doctors have written over 7 million prescriptions for 50 million tablets
for more than 3 million patients. At the end of 1998, VIAGRA was being sold in
40 countries including the U.S. and the European Union.

     Our other major pharmaceutical products include GLUCOTROL XL, for the
treatment of diabetes, and ZYRTEC, which is used for the

                                       2

<PAGE>

treatment of allergies and related problems. ZYRTEC is licensed to us by the
Belgian company, UCB S.A., for sales in the U.S. and Canada. We copromote
ZYRTEC in the U.S. with a subsidiary of UCB S.A.

     In December 1998, the FDA approved CELEBREX for the relief of symptoms of
adult rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. We will copromote CELEBREX with
G.D. Searle & Co. (Searle), a division of Monsanto Company, the discoverer and
developer of CELEBREX, in all world markets except Japan. In February 1999, we
launched CELEBREX with Searle in the U.S.

     Prospective new products under development are discussed in the section
below entitled RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

CONSUMER HEALTH CARE GROUP

     Our Consumer Health Care Group products include non-prescription
over-the-counter (OTC) medications, therapeutic skin care products and personal
care products. Among our better-known brands in the U.S. are:

o VISINE eyedrops
o BENGAY topical analgesics 
o CORTIZONE hydrocortisone skin cream 
o RID anti-lice products 
o UNISOM sleep aids 
o DESITIN ointments 
o BAIN DE SOLEIL sun care products 
o PLAX pre-brushing dental rinse 
o BARBASOL shave creams and gels

Several product-line extensions building on these brands have been introduced in
recent years. Other products are sold only in selected international markets.
Sales of the Consumer Health Care Group accounted for 3%, 4% and 5% of our total
revenues in 1998, 1997 and 1996.

     Our Consumer Health Care Group can expand sales of some of our prescription
medications by converting them to OTC medications. For example, an OTC
formulation of DIFLUCAN, known as DIFLUCAN ONE, is sold in the U.K. as a
treatment for vaginal candidiasis. Similarly, ZYRTEC is sold as an OTC product
in Canada under the brand name REACTINE. As market conditions permit, and when
we have necessary approval from drug regulatory authorities, we plan to pursue
similar launches for other products.

ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT

     Our Animal Health Group discovers, develops, manufactures and sells
products for the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock, poultry and
companion animals. We are a significant manufacturer of antibiotics,
antiparasitics, anti-inflammatories, vaccines and related products for livestock
and companion animals. Animal Health sales accounted for approximately 10% of
our total revenues in 1998 and 12% of our total revenues in both 1997 and 1996.

     Our leading Animal Health product in 1998 was DECTOMAX, a treatment for
internal and external parasites, primarily in cattle. While there is substantial
generic competition, sales of DECTOMAX increased due to the growth of the
injectable formulation, and the introduction of the pour-on formulation in some
international markets. It provides longer protection against a broader spectrum
of parasites than many other products. RIMADYL, a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory for treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs, is one of the
top-selling animal health care products in the U.S. In 1998, we launched ANIPRYL
in the U.S. as a treatment for dogs suffering from Cushing's disease, an
endocrine disorder. It has also recently been approved and launched in the U.S.
and Canada for treatment of canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome.

     The other principal products of our Animal Health Group are TERRAMYCIN
LA-200, an injectable version of the Terramycin broad-spectrum antibiotic used
for various animal diseases; our BANMINTH, NEMEX, VALBAZEN and PARATECT products
to treat internal parasites; COXISTAC and AVIAX anticoccidials to treat
parasitic infection in poultry; and MECADOX, an antibacterial for pigs. We also
manufacture and sell an extensive line of cattle, swine and companion animal
vaccines including BOVISHIELD, RESPISURE, LEUKOCELL and VANGUARD.

                                       3


<PAGE>


     In December 1998, the Council of European Agricultural Ministers voted to
ban the use of our antibiotic feed additive, STAFAC (virginiamycin), throughout
the European Union. The ban becomes effective at the end of June, 1999. We are
seeking a reversal of this decision through legal action. We do not expect any
ban on sales of STAFAC to have a material effect on future results of the
Company's operations.

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

     Innovation by our research and development operations is very important to
the success of our businesses. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to
market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs. This goal has
been supported by our substantial research and development investments. We spent
approximately $2.3 billion in 1998, $1.8 billion in 1997 and $1.6 billion in
1996 on Company-sponsored research and development.

     We are planning for future growth of our research operations. Current
construction at our three major research centers will add approximately one
million square feet of laboratory space. Other research facilities are also
being added or expanded.

     We conduct research internally, and also through contracts with third
parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies,
and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms. We also seek out innovative
technologies developed by third parties to acquire or incorporate into our
product lines through licensing or other arrangements.

     Drug development is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. On
average, only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by
researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an
approved medicine. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take
more than ten years. Candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even
late-stage product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval.

     In view of the limited period of patent protection, and to gain the
marketing advantage of being first to market in a particular therapeutic
category, we try to be efficient as well as careful in our new product
development. We strive to minimize delays in handling new product candidates and
look for opportunities, such as contracting studies to outside researchers, to
move development forward efficiently.

     We feel that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number
of pharmaceutical compounds and new therapies we have in all stages of
development. In recent years, our discovery scientists have delivered dozens of
new chemical compounds to early evaluation drug development stages. While each
new candidate is far from regulatory approval, new drug candidates are the
foundation for future products. A table and discussion of supplemental filings
for existing products and drug candidates in development is set out under the
heading PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS on page 30 of our 1998 Annual Report. That table
and discussion are incorporated by reference.

     Our research operations add value to our existing products by improving
their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them. In 1998, for example,
the FDA approved the additional use of ZYRTEC for the treatment of allergies in
children two to five years of age.

     Our competitors also devote substantial sums and resources to research and
development. In addition, the consolidation that has occurred in our industry
has created additional companies with substantial research and development
resources. The competition fostered by the fruits of this research could result
in erosion of sales and unanticipated product obsolescence.

                                       4

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

     We have significant operations outside the United States. They are
conducted both through our subsidiaries and through distributors, and involve
the same business segments - pharmaceutical and animal health - as our U.S.
operations.

     Japan is our second-largest single national market, with revenues of 7%. No
other single country outside the U.S. had revenues approaching 10% of our total
revenues.

     For a breakdown of revenues by major country areas, see the table 
GEOGRAPHIC DATA on page 60 of our 1998 Annual Report.  That information is 
incorporated by reference.

     Our international businesses are subject, in varying degrees, to a number
of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. These include:

o currency fluctuations 
o capital and exchange control regulations 
o expropriation and nationalization 
o other restrictive government actions 

Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints,
including laws on pricing or reimbursement for use of products. See the section
below GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS for discussion of those
matters.

     In 1998, currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar reduced our
reported revenues in many countries. Depending on the direction of change
relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can either improve or
reduce the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. We
cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the
effect they will have on us. We attempt to anticipate such changes, however, and
try to mitigate their effects. See Note 5-D to our financial statements,
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, on pages 47 to 48 in our Annual Report. That
discussion is incorporated by reference. Related information about valuation and
risks associated with such financial instruments in parts E and F of that same
Note is also incorporated by reference.

MARKETING

     In our global pharmaceuticals business, we promote our products to health
care providers such as doctors, nurse practitioners and hospitals, Pharmacy
Benefit Managers and Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). We also market directly
to consumers in the United States through direct-to-consumer print and
television advertising. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate
the public about our innovative medical research.

     Our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations. Each
sales organization markets a distinct group of products. We increased our sales
force over the past several years so that our recently introduced products and
late-stage candidates will reach their full potential. Our U.S. pharmaceutical
sales representatives total approximately 5,400. This number reflects the
creation of a new primary-care sales force, and a specialty sales force
dedicated largely to rheumatology, as well as the expansion of other specialty
sales forces in the U.S. Overseas operations employ about 12,300 sales
representatives.

     Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to
wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, including hospitals,
clinics, government agencies and pharmacies.

     Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses and
advantages of our products to medical professionals. We work to gain access to
MCO formularies (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products
compiled by pharmacists and physicians) by demonstrating the qualities and
treatment benefits of our products. We also work with MCOs to assist them with
disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical
treatment routines.

     Marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals depends to a degree on complex
decisions about the scope of clinical trials made years before product approval.
All drugs must complete 

                                       5

<PAGE>

clinical trials required by regulatory authorities to show they are safe and 
effective for treating one or more particular medical problems. A manufacturer 
may choose, however, to undertake additional studies to demonstrate additional 
advantages of a compound, including comparative clinical trials with competitive
products.

     Those studies can be costly, the results are uncertain, and they can take
years to complete. Balancing these considerations makes it difficult to decide
whether and when to undertake such additional studies. But, when they are
successful, such studies can have a major impact on approved claims and
marketing strategies.

     Our Consumer Health Care Group uses its own representatives to promote its
products. We use substantial print and television consumer advertising for our
consumer health care products. Those products are sold through various
retailers.

     Separate sales organizations also are used by our Animal Health business to
promote its products. Its advertising and promotion are generally targeted to
health professionals, directly and through medical journals. Animal health and
nutrition products are sold through veterinarians, drug wholesalers,
distributors, retail outlets and directly to users, including feed manufacturers
and animal producers. Where appropriate, these products are also marketed
through print and television advertising.

     During 1998, pharmaceutical sales to our three largest pharmaceutical and
consumer health care products wholesalers were:

o     McKesson Corporation - 14% of our total revenues;

o     Cardinal Health, Inc. - 12% of our total revenues; and

o     Bergen Brunswig Corporation - 10% of our total revenues.

     Those sales were concentrated in the Pharmaceutical segment. Apart from
these instances, none of our business segments is dependent on any one or group
of related customers.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

     Our products are sold around the world under brand-name trademarks we
consider in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark protection
continues in some countries as long as the mark is used; in other countries, as
long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable,
terms.

    We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents. These patents cover:

o     pharmaceutical products
o     pharmaceutical formulations
o     product manufacturing processes
o     intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing

     Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the
date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by
a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in the
country.

     In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of material importance
to our businesses in the United States and most other countries. Based on
current product sales, and considering the vigorous competition with products
sold by others, the patent rights we consider significant in relation to our
business as a whole are those for NORVASC, CARDURA, ZITHROMAX, ZOLOFT, DIFLUCAN,
GLUCOTROL XL, VIAGRA, and TROVAN. Our basic U.S. patents relating to NORVASC,
ZOLOFT, DIFLUCAN, GLUCOTROL XL, TROVAN and VIAGRA expire between 2004 and 2011.
The U.S. patent on CARDURA expires in 2000.

     PROCARDIA XL employs a novel sustained-release drug-delivery system
developed and patented by Alza Corporation. We hold an exclusive license to use
this delivery system 

                                       6


<PAGE>

with the active ingredient in PROCARDIA XL. The patents on the system run until 
2003. Other companies also offer sustained-release forms of that ingredient or 
have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of such products. One such
product that has been approved has not been rated by the FDA to be appropriate 
for substitution in place of PROCARDIA XL. Another product filed with the FDA 
for approval in 1997 uses a form of the active ingredient that we believe 
infringes our patents, and we have sued to prevent that improper use. Additional
products were filed for FDA approval in 1998, and also appear to infringe our
patents. (See the discussion of these matters in Item 3 below. Also see the 
discussion below about PROCARDIA XL sales in the section CAUTIONARY FACTORS 
THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.) It is not possible to predict the timing and 
impact on sales of PROCARDIA XL of competition from other products.

     ZITHROMAX is patented by Pliva, a Croatian pharmaceutical company. The drug
is licensed exclusively to us by Pliva for sales and marketing in major
countries, and we purchase the compound in bulk crude form from Pliva. Pliva's
U.S. patent on ZITHROMAX expires in 2005.

     We have other patent rights covering additional products that have smaller
sales revenues. The U.S. patent for one such product, UNASYN, expires in 1999.

     We expect that the patents on some of our newest products and late-stage
product candidates could become significant to our business as a whole in the
future.

     The expiration of a product patent normally results in significant
competition from generic products against the covered product and, particularly
in the U.S., can result in a dramatic reduction in sales of the pioneering
product. In some cases, however, we can continue to obtain commercial benefits
from:

o    product manufacturing trade secrets
o    patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture 
     of the active ingredients
o    patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms
o    conversion of the active ingredient to over-the-counter products

     The effect of product patent expiration also depends upon:

o    the nature of the market and the position of the product in it
o    the growth of the market
o    the complexities and economics of manufacture of the product
o    the requirements of generic drug laws

     One of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the
U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection of our products.
Under international agreements in recent years, global protection of
intellectual property rights is improving. Under the North American Free Trade
Agreement, Mexico improved its patent law to provide patent protection to
pharmaceutical products. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade requires
participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide
patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a ten-year
transition period. A number of countries are doing this. We have experienced
significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations and our continued
business expansion in those countries depends to a large degree on further
patent protection improvement.

COMPETITION

     Competition is intense in all of our businesses, and includes many large
and small competitors.

     The principal means of competition varies among product categories and
business groups. Technological innovations affecting:

o        efficacy
o        safety
o        patients' ease of use, and
o        cost effectiveness

                                       7

<PAGE>


are important to success in all of our businesses. Our businesses also focus on
unmet medical needs and therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation has
led to our multi-billion dollar research and development investments over the
past decade.

     Our pharmaceutical business competes with worldwide research-based drug
companies, many smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus,
and generic drug manufacturers. Our pharmaceutical operations are among the
largest in the world.

     In recent years, a comparison of the total cost of medical treatments using
pharmaceuticals versus alternative treatments for the same condition has become
an important basis of competition. Managed Care Organizations and Pharmacy
Benefit Managers look to cost advantages as well as medical benefits in making
their drug formulary decisions.

     Our pharmaceutical sales and marketing organization is a valuable
competitive asset. Our salespeople's ability to reach medical professionals with
information about our products helps us respond to competitive efforts and
launch new products.

     Many other companies, large and small, manufacture and sell one or more 
products that are similar to our consumer health care products. Sources of
competitive advantage in the OTC market include:

o    product quality and efficacy
o    brand identity
o    advertising and promotion
o    product innovation
o    broad distribution capabilities
o    customer satisfaction
o    price

Heavy expenditures for advertising, promotion and marketing are generally
required to achieve consumer acceptance of consumer health care products.

     We have a significant presence in the animal health marketplace, but many
other companies offer competitive products. Altogether, there are hundreds of
producers of animal health products throughout the world. The principal methods
of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product. They include:

o    product innovation
o    service
o    price
o    quality
o    effective promotion to veterinary professionals and consumers

We promote our products directly through our sales representatives as well as
through advertising.

     In the current environment of competitive pressures on profit margins, we
continue efforts to control the growth of our expenses. Although research and
development budgets have grown significantly, we have kept our costs down in
other areas such as manufacturing, distribution and sales administration by
restructuring and consolidating facilities. These measures have brought us new
efficiencies and reduced or contained our operating expenses.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

     The growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. has been a
major factor in the competitive make-up of the health care marketplace. Over
half the U.S. population now participates in some version of managed care.
Because of the size of the patient population covered by MCOs, marketing of
prescription drugs to them and the Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) that serve
many of those organizations has become important to our business.

     MCOs can include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators,
health-maintenance organizations, alliances of hospitals and physicians and
other physician organizations. The purchasing power of MCOs has been increasing
in recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients. At the same
time, those organizations have been consolidating into fewer, even larger
entities. 

                                       8

<PAGE>



This enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us.

     A major objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce health
care expenditures. They typically use volume purchases and long-term contracts
to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers. They use their purchasing
power to bargain for lower supplier prices. They also emphasize primary and
preventive care, out-patient treatment, and procedures performed at doctors'
offices and clinics. Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive
forms of treatment, are carefully managed.

     As discussed above in MARKETING, MCOs and PBMs typically develop
formularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies can be based on
the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products. Due to their
lower cost, generic medicines are often favored. The breadth of the products
covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many
formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of
particular medical problems. MCOs use a variety of means to encourage patients'
use of products listed on their formularies.

     Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced
usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies
compete aggressively to have their products included. Where possible, companies
compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products, such as
greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower
overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate
fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on
price.

     The growth of MCOs also appears to have led to greater usage of some drugs.
The use of certain drugs can prevent the need for more costly treatments such as
hospitalization, professional therapy, or even surgery. Because of these
advantages, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments. In addition,
the current trend of some patients to opt for managed care alternatives to
Medicare may increase overall pharmaceutical usage among that elderly
population. Medicare generally does not pay for medicines, so the patients must
bear that cost. MCOs, however, often offer significant drug benefits for their
participants.

     These developments have not only created pressure on prices, but also have
increased sales of products on formularies. We have been generally, although not
universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO
formularies.

     Another way we address the interests of MCOs is by developing disease
management programs. These programs can be attractive to MCOs by improving
patient communications and compliance with dosage directions, which are
important for effective disease treatment. They can help MCOs address various
aspects of disease management, such as prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
certain diseases, including use of pharmaceutical products. This comprehensive
approach can improve the quality of care and lower costly complications of
chronic diseases.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

     One of the biggest competitive challenges we face in the U.S. is from
generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration of U.S. patent
protection on an important product, we can lose the major portion of U.S. sales
of the product within a year. Generic competitors operate without our large
research and development expenses and our costs of conveying medical information
about the product to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval
process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to
demonstrate their safety and efficacy, and allows generic manufacturers to rely
on the safety and efficacy of the pioneer product. Generic products need only
demonstrate a level of availability in the blood stream equivalent to that of
the pioneer product. This means that after we have borne the

                                       9


<PAGE>



expenses of discovering, developing and testing a medicine for safety and 
efficacy, obtaining regulatory approval and informing the medical community 
about its therapeutic benefits, generic competitors can charge much less for a
competing version of our product and still be profitable.

     As noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs
may favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the
use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their health care
programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and
in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been
rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to a
brand-name drug. The substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician
expressly forbids it.

     Some of our competitors who produce patented pharmaceuticals have entered
the generic market; in some cases offering generic versions of their own
brand-name products. We have not followed that strategy. Instead, we focus our
resources on developing and marketing innovative new products and treatments.

RAW MATERIALS

     Raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the
ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials
are widely available from multiple sources. No serious shortages or delays were
encountered in 1998, and none are expected in 1999.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

     Pharmaceutical companies are subject to heavy regulation by a number of
national, state and local agencies. Of particular importance is the FDA in the
United States. It has jurisdiction over all our businesses and administers
requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, approval,
manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our pharmaceutical products. In some
cases, FDA requirements and/or reviews have increased the amount of time and
money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market.

     The FDA also regulates our consumer health care products and, along with
the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency, our
animal health products. Some regulatory actions pertaining to our products are
discussed in Item 3 of this report.

     Since the beginning of 1998, the approval of new drugs across the European
Union (EU) is possible only using the European Medicines Evaluation Agency's
(EMEA) mutual recognition or central approval processes. The use of either of
these procedures should provide a more rapid and consistent approval across all
fifteen member states than was the case when the approval processes were
operating independently within each member state. In addition, the agreement
between the EU and ten Eastern European states to base their approvals on the
centralized EU approval will significantly speed the regulatory process in those
countries. The EMEA does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or
pricing matters in EU member countries, however. We will continue to deal with
individual countries on such issues.

     In recent years, various legislative proposals have been offered in
Congress and in some state legislatures that would bring about major changes in
the affected health care systems. Some states have passed such legislation, and
further federal and state proposals are possible. These could include price or
patient reimbursement constraints on medicines and restrictions on access to
certain products. Similar issues exist in many foreign countries where we do
business. We cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives, but we will work to
maintain patient access to our products and to oppose price constraints.

     Also in the U.S., proposals have called for substantial changes in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. If such changes are 

                                       10

<PAGE>

enacted, they may require significant reductions from currently projected 
government expenditures for these programs. Driven by budget concerns, Medicaid 
managed care systems have been under consideration in several states. If the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs implement changes that restrict the access of a 
significant population of patients to our innovative medicines, our business 
could be materially affected. On the other hand, relatively little 
pharmaceutical use is currently covered by Medicare. As noted above, if changes
to these programs shift patients to MCOs that cover pharmaceuticals, usage of 
pharmaceuticals could increase.

     Legislation in the U.S. requires us to give rebates to state Medicaid
agencies based on each state's reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under
the Medicaid program. We also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or
reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state
agencies and programs. See the discussion regarding rebates on page 29 of our
1998 Annual Report for details on the cost to us of such discounts and rebates,
which is incorporated by reference.

     We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other
countries. For example, in 1997, Japan announced a price reduction on drugs. In
Europe and some other international markets, the government provides health care
at low direct cost to consumers, and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient
reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care
system.

     This international patchwork of price regulation has led to inconsistent
prices and some third-party trade in our products from markets with low prices.
Such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our
sales in markets with higher prices.

     We are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other regulatory and
enforcement departments and agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and
the Department of Justice in the U.S., and are, therefore, subject to possible
administrative and legal proceedings and actions by those organizations. Such
actions may include product recalls, seizures and other civil and criminal
sanctions. In some cases, we have initiated product recalls voluntarily.

     It is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding
legislative and regulatory requirements affecting us.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

     Most of our manufacturing and certain research operations are affected by
federal, state and local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to
continue to make, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. We
are also cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity
at certain sites (see Item 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, below). As a result, we
incurred capital and operational expenditures in 1998 for environmental
protection and clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows:

o    environmental-related capital expenditures- $51 million 
o    other environmental-related expenses-$76 million 

While we cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such clean up
activities, capital expenditures, or operating costs for environmental
compliance, we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

YEAR 2000 COMPUTER SYSTEMS COMPLIANCE

     Many older computer software programs refer to years in terms of their
final two digits only. Such programs may interpret the year 2000 to mean the
year 1900, or another year instead. If not corrected, those programs could cause
date-related or operational transaction failures. We developed a Compliance
Assurance Process to address the Year 2000 issue in four phases: Inventory,
Assessment and Planning, Implementation and Certification. No significant
information technology projects 

                                       11

<PAGE>

have been deferred as a result of our efforts on Year 2000.

     The Inventory phase included preliminary problem determination, an
inventory of information technology (IT) and non-IT hardware and software and an
inventory of our key business systems and material vendors and business
processes. Such systems relate to our research and development, production,
distribution, financial, administrative and communication operations. This phase
was substantially completed at the end of 1998. We have requested our critical
vendors, major customers, service suppliers, communication providers, product
alliance partners and banks to verify their Year 2000 readiness and are
currently evaluating their responses. This evaluation is complete for all of our
critical trading partners, but continues for non-critical partners.

     During our Assessment and Planning phase each inventoried item is assessed
to evaluate its risk, to decide whether to remediate or replace, to identify its
priority and to develop a plan for the system. Systems are prioritized based on
their importance to the business, risk of failure, time horizon to failure and
dependency on other critical items. This phase was 90% complete at December 31,
1998, and will be finished by the first quarter of 1999.

     The plans developed during the Assessment and Planning phase are being
executed in the Implementation phase. Remediation and replacement of non-Year
2000 compliant systems is in process and we expect our critical systems to be
substantially remediated or replaced by March 31, 1999. The remaining systems,
including embedded systems, will be modified by the end of the third quarter of
1999. While our Implementation efforts are approximately 65% complete, this
phase will overlap with the Certification phase.

     During the Certification phase, we will be testing and certifying the
results of our remediation efforts. Testing begins as systems are remediated and
will continue throughout 1999. Testing attempts to verify that all of our
systems function correctly and extend to all interfaces with key business
partners. We expect to substantially complete testing of critical systems by
March 31, 1999, and the testing of the remaining systems and key third-party
systems by the end of the third quarter of 1999.

     Because the Company's year 2000 compliance is dependent upon key third
parties also being Year 2000 compliant on a timely basis, there can be no
guarantee that the Company's efforts will prevent a material adverse impact on
its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. If our systems or
those of key third parties are not fully Year 2000 functional, we estimate that
up to a two-week disruption in operations could occur. Such a disruption could
result in delays in the distribution of finished goods or receipt of raw
materials, errors in customer order taking, disruption of clinical activities or
delays in product development. These consequences could have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows if we
are unable to substantially conduct our business in the ordinary course. We
believe that our efforts, including the development of a contingency plan, will
significantly reduce the adverse impact that any disruption in business might
have.

     As part of the contingency plan being developed, Business Continuity Plans
(the Plans) will address critical areas of our business. The Plans will be
designed to mitigate serious disruptions to our business flow beyond the end of
1999 and operate independent of our external providers' Year 2000 compliance.
The Plans will likely provide for maintaining increased inventory to meet
customer needs, protecting the integrity of ongoing activities, identifying and
securing alternate sources of critical services, materials and utilities when
possible and establishing crisis teams to address unexpected problems. We expect
to complete the preliminary Plans by the end of the first quarter of 1999 and
the final Plans by the end of the second quarter of 1999.

                                       12

<PAGE>

     We estimate that the total cost involved in our Year 2000 program is
approximately $127 million of which $36 million has been incurred as of the end
of 1998. Costs for 1999 are estimated to be approximately $91 million, which
reflect changes in estimates and the inclusion of accelerated replacement costs
as a result of a clarification in disclosure guidelines of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. These costs are expensed as incurred, except for
capitalizable hardware of $5 million in 1998 and $15 million estimated for 1999
and are being funded through operating cash flows. Such costs do not include
normal system upgrades and replacements.

     Both our cost estimates and completion timeframes will be influenced by our
ability to successfully identify Year 2000 problems, the nature and amount of
programming required to fix the programs, the availability and cost of personnel
trained in this area and the Year 2000 compliance success that key third parties
attain. As the development of contingency plans continues, the costs to complete
our Year 2000 program may increase. While these and other unforeseen factors
could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial
condition, we believe that our ongoing efforts to address the Year 2000 issue
will minimize the possible negative consequences to our Company.

CORPORATE/FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARIES

     We conduct international banking operations through a subsidiary, Pfizer
International Bank Europe (PIBE), based in Dublin, Ireland. PIBE, incorporated
under the laws of Ireland, operates under a banking license from the Central
Bank of Ireland. It makes loans and accepts deposits in several currencies in
international markets. PIBE is an active Euromarket lender to high quality
corporations and governments through its portfolio of loans and money market
instruments. Loans are made primarily on a short and medium term basis,
typically with floating interest rates.

     We also own an insurance operation, The Kodiak Company Limited, which
reinsures certain assets, inland transport and marine cargo of our international
operations. Financial data for these subsidiaries are set out in Note 3 to our
financial statements, FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARIES, on page 45 in our 1998 Annual
Report, which is incorporated by reference.

TAX MATTERS

     The discussion of tax-related matters (including certain proceedings
involving proposed tax adjustments relating to prior years) in Note 8 to our
financial statements, TAXES ON INCOME, on pages 50 through 51 in the Annual
Report is incorporated by reference.

EMPLOYEES

     In our innovation-intensive business, our employees are vital to our
success. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. As of
December 31, 1998, we employed approximately 46,400 people in our operations
throughout the world. Geographically, this total breaks down as follows:

o    United States, 18,200
o    Europe, 13,300
o    Asia, 7,800
o    Canada/Latin America, 5,600
o    Africa/Middle East, 1,500

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 
1995)

OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS REPORT AND IN OUR 1998 ANNUAL REPORT TO
SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
GIVE OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS. YOU CAN IDENTIFY
THESE STATEMENTS BY THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR
CURRENT FACTS. THEY USE WORDS SUCH AS "ANTICIPATE," "ESTIMATE," "EXPECT,"
"PROJECT," "INTEND," "PLAN," "BELIEVE," AND OTHER WORDS AND TERMS 

                                       13

<PAGE>

OF SIMILAR MEANING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR 
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO
FUTURE ACTIONS, PROSPECTIVE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT APPROVALS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE 
OR RESULTS OF CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS, SALES EFFORTS, EXPENSES, THE 
OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES SUCH AS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. FROM 
TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO MAY PROVIDE ORAL OR WRITTEN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN 
OTHER MATERIALS WE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC.

ANY OR ALL OF OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT, IN THE 1998 ANNUAL
REPORT AND IN ANY OTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS WE MAKE MAY TURN OUT TO BE WRONG. THEY
CAN BE AFFECTED BY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS WE MIGHT MAKE OR BY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MANY FACTORS MENTIONED IN THE DISCUSSION ABOVE - FOR
EXAMPLE, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, YEAR 2000 SYSTEMS COMPLIANCE,
GENERIC PRODUCT COMPETITION AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT - WILL BE IMPORTANT
IN DETERMINING FUTURE RESULTS. CONSEQUENTLY, NO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CAN BE
GUARANTEED. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,
WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE
ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED SUBJECTS
IN OUR 10-Q, 8-K AND 10-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE
FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE
ASSUMPTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT WE THINK COULD
CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL
RESULTS. OTHER FACTORS BESIDES THOSE LISTED HERE COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
COMPANY. THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES
LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

o    Balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major
     challenge. Our ongoing investments in new product introductions and
     research and development for future products could exceed corresponding
     sales growth. This could produce higher costs without a proportional
     increase in revenues.

o    In the U.S., many of our pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing
     price pressures as managed care groups, pharmacy benefit managers and
     government agencies seek price discounts. Government efforts to reduce
     Medicare and Medicaid expenses are expected to increase the use of managed
     care. This may result in managed care influencing prescription decisions
     for a larger segment of the population. International operations are also
     subject to price and marketing regulations. As a result, it is expected
     that pressures on pricing and operating results will continue and could
     affect future results.

o    Thirty-nine percent of our 1998 revenues arise from international
     operations, and we expect revenue and net income growth in 1999 to be
     impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Revenues from Asia comprised
     approximately 12% of total revenues in 1998 (although revenues from the
     Asian markets most impacted by recent economic events - Korea, Indonesia,
     Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan - comprised only 1% of 1998
     total revenues). Revenues from Latin America comprised 5% of our total
     revenues in 1998, including 2% from Brazil.

     These foreign-based revenues as well as our substantial international
     assets result in our exposure to currency exchange rate changes. In
     addition, our interest-bearing investments, loans and borrowings are
     subject to interest rate change risk. The risks of such changes and the
     measures we have taken to help contain those risks are discussed in the
     section entitled FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT on pages 36 and 37 in our 1998
     Annual Report. For additional details, see Note 5-D to our financial
     statements, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, on pages 47 and 48 in our
     1998 Annual Report. Those sections of the Annual Report are incorporated by
     reference.

     Notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes
     in fiscal

                                       14

     circumstances such as these, we cannot predict with certainty all changes
     in currency and interest rates, inflation or other related factors
     affecting our businesses. These factors could affect future results.

o    A new European currency (Euro) was introduced in January 1999 to eventually
     replace the separate currencies of eleven individual countries. This
     entails changes in our operations as we modify systems and commercial
     arrangements to deal with the new currency. Modifications are necessary in
     operations such as payroll, benefits and pension systems, contracts with
     suppliers and customers and internal financial reporting systems. Although
     there is a three-year transition period during which transactions may be
     made in the old currencies, this may require dual currency processes for
     our operations. We have identified issues involved and are developing and
     implementing solutions. The cost of this effort is not expected to have a
     material effect on our business or results of operations. There is no
     guarantee, however, that all problems have been foreseen and corrected, or
     that no material disruption will occur in our business. The conversion to
     the Euro may have competitive implications on our pricing and marketing
     strategies; however, the full impact is not known at this time.

o    International operations could be affected by changes in intellectual
     property legal protections and remedies, trade regulations, and procedures
     and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and
     marketing of products, as well as by unstable governments and legal
     systems, intergovernmental disputes and possible nationalization.

o    Cost-containment measures employed by governments that have the effect of
     limiting patient access to medicines and related issues described above in
     GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS affect the growth and
     profitability of our operations in some countries. Those factors could
     affect future results.

o    Business combinations among our competitors could affect our competitive
     position in the pharmaceutical, consumer health care and animal health
     businesses. Similarly, combinations among our major customers could
     increase their purchasing power in dealing with us. And, of course, if we
     ourselves should enter into one or more business combinations, our
     business, finances and capital structure could be affected.

o    Generic competition is a major challenge in the U.S. Loss of patent
     protection typically leads to dramatic loss of sales in the U.S. market and
     could affect future results.

o    Risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to product-related
     forward-looking statements. The outcome of the lengthy and complex process
     of identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently
     uncertain. Prospective products can fail to receive regulatory approval.
     There are also many considerations that can affect marketing of
     pharmaceutical products around the world. Regulatory delays; the inability
     to successfully complete clinical trials; claims and concerns about safety
     and efficacy; new discoveries; patents and products by competitors and
     related patent disputes; and claims about adverse side effects are a few of
     the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and
     development and product-related forward-looking statements.

o    As discussed above in MARKETING, decisions about research studies made
     early in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial
     impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval. More
     detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the
     marketing, but they consume time and resources and can delay submitting the
     drug candidate for initial approval. We try to plan clinical trials
     prudently, but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and
     testing will be made in each case. The quality of our decisions in this
     area can affect our future results.

o    Difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing, including,
     but not limited to, the inability to build up production

                                       15

<PAGE>

     capacity commensurate with demand, or the failure to predict market demand
     for or gain market acceptance of approved products could affect future
     results.

o    We currently have three products, NORVASC, ZITHROMAX and ZOLOFT, with
     annual sales exceeding one billion dollars. Those products accounted for
     approximately 40% of our 1998 revenues. If these or any of our other major
     products were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent
     protection, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, publicity
     affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from competitive
     products, or if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the
     impact on our revenues could be significant.

o    We cannot always predict with accuracy the timing or impact of possible
     future competition on sales of our products. For example, PROCARDIA XL, our
     patented form of sustained-release nifedipine, has been an important
     product for us, but its sales have been declining, and we expect that to
     continue. Sales of PROCARDIA XL were $1,005 million in 1996, $822 million
     in 1997, and $714 million in 1998. This decline has been due, at least in
     part, to the medical community's increased emphasis on our more advanced
     product, NORVASC. It is also partly attributable to the fact that there has
     been another form of sustained-release nifedipine available on the market
     since 1993, although it is not approved for treatment of all the same
     indications as PROCARDIA XL. Additional potentially competitive products
     have been filed for FDA approval. This indicates that the number of
     medicines that compete with PROCARDIA XL may increase, and the sales of
     competing products may affect our expected results.

o    During 1995, the authors of some non-clinical studies questioned the safety
     of calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Although the clinical evidence
     supported the safety of this class of medications, the FDA convened an
     advisory panel to review their safety. In 1996, that advisory panel found
     no data to support challenges to the safety of newer sustained-release and
     intrinsically long-acting CCBs (such as NORVASC and PROCARDIA XL - products
     for treatment of hypertension and angina).

     Questions about this class of products continued throughout 1997, however,
     and included scientific publications and presentations asserting that these
     products were associated with various serious medical conditions.

     During 1997, data from newly conducted studies and reviews and decisions by
     two national regulatory authorities, plus newly published National
     Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines, were all supportive of the safety of
     long-acting CCBs like NORVASC and PROCARDIA XL and of their appropriateness
     as first-line medications in the treatment of hypertension.

     We continue to believe that the safety and effectiveness of NORVASC and
     PROCARDIA XL are supported by a large body of data from numerous studies
     and the daily clinical experiences of physicians around the world. It is
     not possible, however, to predict the impact on our future sales, if any,
     of existing or future studies, regulatory agency actions or a continuing
     debate regarding CCBs.

o    Growth in costs and expenses, changes in product mix and the impact of
     divestitures, restructuring and other unusual items that could result from
     evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization, and
     organizational restructuring could affect future results. For example, we
     may be unable to maintain or further enhance those margin improvements
     achieved in recent years, which would affect future results.

o    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE
     INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, which becomes effective for our
     financial statements beginning January 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires a
     company to recognize all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in
     its balance sheet and measure them at fair value. We do not expect the
     adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on our


                                       16

<PAGE>



     financial statements. The American Institute of Certified Public
     Accountants issued Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, ACCOUNTING FOR THE
     COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE and SOP
     98-5, REPORTING ON THE COSTS OF START-UP ACTIVITIES, which are effective
     for our 1999 financial statements. We do not expect the adoption of these
     SOPs to have a material impact on our financial statements.

     Such new or revised accounting standards and rules are issued from time to
     time. Although the standards mentioned above are not expected to have a
     material impact on our reported financial results, future standards and
     rules could have such an effect.

o    As described above in the section YEAR 2000 COMPUTER SYSTEMS COMPLIANCE, we
     are working to address "Year 2000" problems. If we should fail to identify
     or fix all such problems in our own operations, or if we are affected by
     the inability of a sole-source supplier or a major customer (such as a
     large drug wholesaler or distributor) to continue operations due to such a
     problem, our operations and/or cash flows could be affected.

o    Changes in the U.S. Tax Code and the tax laws of other countries can affect
     our net earnings. For example, pursuant to the Small Jobs Protection Act of
     1996 (the ACT), Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code was repealed for
     tax years beginning after December 31, 1995. Section 936 had created the
     U.S. possessions corporation income tax credit, which gave us tax benefits
     for certain operations in Puerto Rico. The Act provided that as an existing
     credit claimant, we are eligible to continue using the credit against the
     tax arising from our manufacturing income earned in Puerto Rico for an
     additional ten-year period. The amount of manufacturing income eligible for
     the credit during this additional period is subject to a cap based on
     income earned prior to 1996 in Puerto Rico. This ten-year extension does
     not apply to investment income earned in Puerto Rico, the credit on which
     expired as of July 1, 1996. The Act did not affect the amendments made to
     Section 936 by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which
     provided for a five-year phase-down of the U.S. possession tax credit from
     100% to 40%. In addition, the Act permitted the extension of the R&D tax
     credit through June 30, 1998. In 1998, this credit was again extended to
     June 30, 1999.

o    Claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries for various legal,
     environmental and tax matters, and additional claims arise from time to
     time. In addition, our operations are subject to international, federal,
     state and local environmental laws and regulations. It is possible that our
     cash flows and results of operations could be affected by the one-time
     impact of the resolution of these contingencies. We believe that the
     ultimate disposition of current matters to the extent not previously
     provided for will not have a material impact on our financial condition or
     cash flows and results of operations, except where specifically commented
     upon in the discussion of such matters in LEGAL PROCEEDINGS in Item 3 in
     this report, and in TAX MATTERS above.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     Our world headquarters is located in several buildings in New York City. We
own two of these buildings, including our main 33-story office tower, and rent
space in others nearby. The 33-story office tower is located on a site we have
leased under a long-term ground lease. Altogether, our headquarters operations
occupy over one million square feet of owned and leased office space in New York
City.

     Our pharmaceutical business owns and leases space for sales and marketing,
administrative support, and customer service functions around the world.

     Our major research and development facilities are located in
manufacturing/R&D complexes that we own containing multiple buildings in Groton,
Connecticut, and Sandwich, England. The buildings at our Groton facility
currently contain approximately three million 


                                       17

<PAGE>

square feet of floor space. Approximately 1.2 million square feet is used for 
manufacturing, and the rest is used for research and development. An additional
550,000 square foot laboratory building, which is expected to house 
approximately 700 new research employees, is currently under construction. The 
Company also began construction in 1998 on an additional 400,000 square foot 
facility on a 24-acre site in nearby New London, Connecticut, to house an 
initial 1,300 employees from the Company's research operations.

     Buildings on our 340 acre Sandwich, England campus house research, our U.K.
pharmaceutical sales office and a production plant. These facilities contain
almost two million square feet of floor space, approximately half of which is
used for research and development. An additional 540,000 square feet of new
research space is under construction.

     We own other important research facilities in Nagoya, Japan; Amboise,
France; and Terre Haute, Indiana. A number of smaller research and development
operations around the world focus principally on their local markets. As
discussed above, we have been expanding our research and development facilities
in recent years to meet the challenges of handling growing research activities.
In 1998, over 1.4 million square feet of research facilities was under
construction at our sites in Amboise, Groton, Sandwich and Nagoya.

     We have 35 production plants serving our pharmaceutical, consumer and 
animal health operations around the world.  Sixteen of these are major 
facilities.  These plants handle one or more of three basic types of production 
processes:

o        fermentation
o        organic synthesis
o        product production

     We have four major fermentation plants:

o        Rixensart, Belgium
o        Sao Paulo, Brazil
o        Nagoya, Japan
o        Sandwich, England, U.K.

     Our major organic synthesis facilities are in three locations:

o        Groton, Connecticut
o        Ringaskiddy, Ireland
o        Barceloneta, Puerto Rico

     We have major product production plants at thirteen sites in ten countries:

o        Sao Paulo, Brazil
o        Dalian, China
o        Amboise, France
o        Illertissen, Germany
o        Latina, Italy
o        Nagoya, Japan
o        Toluca, Mexico
o        Sandwich, England, U.K.
o        Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, U.S.
o        Brooklyn, New York, U.S.
o        Parsippany, New Jersey, U.S.
o        Terre Haute, Indiana, U.S.
o        Valencia, Venezuela

     Our Consumer Health Care Group has its principal executive offices in the
Company's world headquarters in New York. Its products are manufactured in a
450,000 square foot U.S. facility in Parsippany, New Jersey, which also houses
its principal research operations, and a plant in San Jose Iturbide, Mexico,
producing hair care products primarily for the Mexican market. Consumer Health
Care's sales and marketing offices are generally leased and shared with local
pharmaceutical sales offices, except in Mexico and the U.K., where Consumer
Health has separate offices.

     Our Animal Health business has new world headquarters in leased offices one
block away from the Company's corporate headquarters in New York City. Animal
Health owns its North American headquarters in Exton, Pennsylvania, and leases
some additional space in a nearby office building. It also owns office space in
Zaventem, Belgium for support of its international operations.

     Most of Animal Health's research and manufacturing facilities are shared
with our pharmaceutical business. We own major manufacturing facilities
producing animal health products in:

                                       18

o        Lincoln, Nebraska
o        Lee's Summit, Missouri
o        Louvain la Neuve, Belgium

     Our distribution operations are serviced by our large, state-of-the-art
distribution and order fulfillment operation in a 280,000 square foot building
on a 20 acre site in Memphis, Tennessee. This centrally located U.S. facility
services the Company's pharmaceutical and consumer health care operations and
also houses some customer service operations. Other U.S. distribution facilities
for those operations are located in Clifton and Parsippany, New Jersey, and
Irvine, California. The Animal Health Group operates its own distribution
facilities.

     In general, our properties are well maintained, adequate and suitable to
their purposes. The growth of our businesses has created space pressures for
certain operations, however. We have responded to such challenges with plans to
provide appropriate facilities as needs are demonstrated. Note 6 to our
financial statements, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT on page 49 in our 1998
Annual Report, which discloses amounts invested in land, buildings and
equipment, and the discussion of investing activities under the heading SUMMARY
OF CASH FLOWS on page 34 of the Annual Report, which describes our capital
expenditures, are incorporated by reference. See, also, the discussion under
Note 11 entitled LEASE COMMITMENTS on page 53 of the Annual Report, which is
also incorporated by reference.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is involved in a number of claims and litigations, including
product liability claims and litigations considered normal in the nature of its
businesses. These include suits involving various pharmaceutical and hospital
products that allege either reaction to or injury from use of the product. In
addition, from time to time the Company is involved in, or is the subject of,
various governmental or agency inquiries or investigations relating to its
businesses.

     On June 9, 1997, the Company received notice of the filing of an
Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) by Mylan Pharmaceuticals for a sustained
release nifedipine product asserted to be bioequivalent to Procardia XL. Mylan's
notice asserted that the proposed formulation does not infringe relevant
licensed Alza and Bayer patents and thus that approval of their ANDA should be
granted before patent expiration. On July 18, 1997, the Company, together with
Bayer AG and Bayer Corporation, filed a patent infringement suit against Mylan
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Laboratories Inc. in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania with respect to Mylan's ANDA.
Suit was filed under Bayer AG's U.S. Patent No. 5,264,446, licensed to the
Company, relating to nifedipine of a specified particle size range. Mylan has
filed its answer denying infringement and a scheduling order has been entered.
Final discovery has been extended to May 3, 1999, with dispositive motions to be
filed by May 21, 1999. On March 15, 1999, the FDA issued a tentative approval
for Mylan's 30 mg. extended release nifedipine tablet. The tentative approval
states that final approval cannot be granted until resolution of the instant
patent litigation, patent expiration or expiration of the statutory stay
provisions, and that the FDA is assured that there is no new information that
would affect final approval.

     On or about February 23, 1998, Bayer AG received notice that Biovail
Laboratories Incorporated had filed an ANDA for a sustained release nifedipine
product asserted to be bioequivalent to one dosage strength (60 mg.) of
Procardia XL. The notice was subsequently received by the Company as well. The
notice asserts that the Biovail product does not infringe Bayer's U.S. Patent
No. 5,264,446. On March 26, 1998, the Company received notice of the filing of
an ANDA by Biovail Laboratories of a 30 mg. dosage formulation of nifedipine
alleged to be bioequivalent to Procardia XL. On April 2, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer
filed a patent infringement action against Biovail, relating to their 60 mg.
nifedipine product, in the United States District Court for the District of
Puerto Rico. On May 6, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer filed a second patent infringement
action in Puerto Rico against Biovail under the same patent with respect to
Biovail's 30 mg. nifedipine product. These actions have been consolidated for
discovery and trial. On April 24, 1998, Biovail Laboratories Inc. brought suit
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania
against the Company and Bayer

                                       19

<PAGE>

seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity of and/or non-infringement of the 
5,264,446 nifedipine patent as well as a finding of violation of the antitrust 
laws. Biovail has also moved to transfer the patent infringement actions from
Puerto Rico to the Western District of Pennsylvania. Pfizer has opposed this 
motion to transfer and on June 19, 1998, moved to dismiss Biovail's declaratory 
judgment action and antitrust action in the Western District of Pennsylvania, 
or in the alternative to stay the action pending the outcome of the infringement
actions in Puerto Rico. On January 4, 1999, the District Court in Pennsylvania 
granted Pfizer's motion for a stay of the antitrust action pending the outcome 
of the infringement actions in Puerto Rico. On January 29, 1999, the District 
Court in Puerto Rico denied Biovail's motion to transfer the patent infringement
actions from Puerto Rico to the Western District of Pennsylvania.

     On April 2, 1998, the Company received notice from Lek U.S.A. Inc. of its
filing of an ANDA for a 60 mg. formulation of nifedipine alleged to be
bioequivalent to Procardia XL. On May 14, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer commenced suit
against Lek for infringement of Bayer's U.S. Patent No. 5,264,446, as well as
for infringement of a second Bayer patent, No. 4,412,986 relating to
combinations of nifedipine with certain polymeric materials. On September 14,
1998, Lek was served with the summons and complaint. Plaintiffs amended the
complaint on November 10, 1998, limiting the action to infringement of U.S.
Patent 4,412,986. On January 19, 1999, Lek filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint alleging infringement of U.S. Patent 4,412,986. Pfizer's response to
this motion was filed on February 25, 1999.

     On November 9, 1998, Pfizer received an ANDA notice letter from Martec
Pharmaceutical, Inc. for generic versions (30 mg., 60 mg., 90 mg.) of Procardia
XL. On or about December 18, 1998, Pfizer received a new ANDA certification
letter stating that the ANDA had actually been filed in the name of Martec
Scientific, Inc. On December 23, 1998, Pfizer brought an action against Martec
Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Martec Scientific, Inc. in the Western District of
Missouri for infringement of Bayer's patent relating to nifedipine of a specific
particle size. On January 26, 1999, a second complaint was filed against Martec
Scientific in the Western District of Missouri based on Martec's new ANDA
certification letter.

     Pfizer filed suit on July 8, 1997, against the FDA in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking a declaratory judgment and
injunctive relief enjoining the FDA from processing Mylan's ANDA or any other
ANDA submission referencing Procardia XL that uses a different extended release
mechanism. Pfizer's suit alleges that extended release mechanisms that are not
identical to the osmotic pump mechanism of Procardia XL constitute different
dosage forms requiring the filing and approval of suitability petitions under
the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act before the FDA can accept an ANDA for filing.
Mylan intervened in Pfizer's suit. On March 31, 1998, the U.S. District Judge
granted the government's motion for summary judgment against the Company. Pfizer
has appealed that decision to the D.C. Court of Appeals and arguments in the
case were heard on February 1, 1999. We are awaiting the decision.

     As previously disclosed, a number of lawsuits and claims have been brought
against the Company and Shiley Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary, alleging
either personal injury from fracture of 60-degree or 70-degree Shiley Convexo
Concave ("C/C") heart valves, or anxiety that properly functioning implanted
valves might fracture in the future, or personal injury from a prophylactic
replacement of a functioning valve.

     In an attempt to resolve all claims alleging anxiety that properly
functioning valves might fracture in the future, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement in January 1992 in BOWLING V. SHILEY, ET AL., a case
brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio,
that established a worldwide settlement class of people with C/C heart valves
and their spouses, except those who elected to 

                                       20

<PAGE>


exclude themselves. The settlement provided for a Consultation Fund of $90 
million, which was fixed by the number of claims filed, from which valve
recipients received payments that are intended to cover their cost of 
consultation with cardiologists or other health care providers with respect to 
their valves. The settlement agreement established a second fund of at least 
$75 million to support C/C valve-related research, including the development 
of techniques to identify valve recipients who may have significant risk of 
fracture, and to cover the unreimbursed medical expenses that valve recipients 
may incur for certain procedures related to the valves. The Company's obligation
as to coverage of these unreimbursed medical expenses is not subject to any 
dollar limitation. Following a hearing on the fairness of the settlement, it was
approved by the court on August 19, 1992, and all appeals have been exhausted.

     Generally, the plaintiffs in all of the pending heart valve litigations
seek money damages. Based on the experience of the Company in defending these
claims to date, including insurance proceeds and reserves, the Company is of the
opinion that these actions should not have a material adverse effect on the
financial position or the results of operations of the Company. Litigation
involving insurance coverage for the Company's heart valve liabilities has been
resolved.

     The Company's operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign
environmental laws and regulations. Under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA" or
"Superfund"), the Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with respect to certain
waste sites with which the Company may have had direct or indirect involvement.
Similar designations have been made by some state environmental agencies under
applicable state superfund laws. Such designations are made regardless of the
extent of the Company's involvement. There are also claims that the Company may
be a responsible party or participant with respect to several waste site matters
in foreign jurisdictions. Such claims have been made by the filing of a
complaint, the issuance of an administrative directive or order, or the issuance
of a notice or demand letter. These claims are in various stages of
administrative or judicial proceedings. They include demands for recovery of
past governmental costs and for future investigative or remedial actions. In
many cases, the dollar amount of the claim is not specified. In most cases,
claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same
recovery or other relief as was asserted against the Company. The Company is
currently participating in remedial action at a number of sites under federal,
state, local and foreign laws.

     To the extent possible with the limited amount of information available at
this time, the Company has evaluated its responsibility for costs and related
liability with respect to the above sites and is of the opinion that the
Company's liability with respect to these sites should not have a material
adverse effect on the financial position or the results of operations of the
Company. In arriving at this conclusion, the Company has considered, among other
things, the payments that have been made with respect to the sites in the past;
the factors, such as volume and relative toxicity, ordinarily applied to
allocate defense and remedial costs at such sites; the probable costs to be paid
by the other potentially responsible parties; total projected remedial costs for
a site, if known; existing technology; and the currently enacted laws and
regulations. The Company anticipates that a portion of these costs and related
liability will be covered by available insurance.

     The Company has entered into a consent decree settling all matters with the
United States Environmental Protection Agency--Region I and the Department of
Justice arising primarily out of a December 1993 multimedia environmental
inspection, as well as certain state inspections, of the Company's Groton,
Connecticut facility. The consent decree provides for the payment of $625,000 in
fines, undertaking of an environmental project at a cost of $150,000 and certain
other operational provisions, the implementation of which will not have a
material adverse effect on the operations of the Company.

     Through the early 1970s, Pfizer Inc. (Minerals Division) and Quigley
Company, Inc. ("Quigley"), a wholly owned subsidiary, sold a minimal amount of
one construction product and several refractory products containing some
asbestos. These sales were discontinued thereafter. Although these sales
represented a minor market share, the Company has been named as one of a number
of defendants in numerous lawsuits. These actions, and actions related to the
Company's sale of talc products in

                                       21

<PAGE>



the past, claim personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing 
products, and nearly all seek general and punitive damages. In these actions, 
the Company or Quigley is typically one of a number of defendants, and both are
members of the Center for Claims Resolution (the "CCR"), a joint defense 
organization of twenty defendants that is defending these claims. The Company 
and Quigley are responsible for varying percentages of defense and liability 
payments for all members of the CCR. A number of cases alleging property damage 
from asbestos-containing products installed in buildings have also been brought
against the Company, but most have been resolved.

     On January 15, 1993, a class action complaint and settlement agreement were
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania involving all personal injury claims by persons who have been
exposed to asbestos-containing products but who have not yet filed a personal
injury action against the members of the CCR (Future Claims Settlement). The
District Court determined that the Future Claims Settlement was fair and
reasonable. Subsequently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit reversed the order of the District Court and on June 27, 1997, the U.S.
Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit's order and decertified the class. The
overturning of the settlement is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company's exposure or on the availability of insurance for the vast majority of
such cases. It is expected, too, that the CCR will attempt to resolve cases in
the same manner as heretofore.

     At approximately the time it filed the Future Claims Settlement class
action, the CCR settled approximately 16,360 personal injury cases on behalf of
its members, including the Company and Quigley. The CCR has continued to settle
remaining and opt-out cases and claims on a similar basis to past settlements.
As of December 28, 1998, there were 57,819 personal injury claims pending
against Quigley (excluding those which are inactive or have been settled in
principle), 33,185 such claims against the Company, and 68 talc cases against
the Company.

     The Company believes that its costs incurred in defending and ultimately
disposing of the asbestos personal injury claims, as well as the property damage
and talc claims, will be largely covered by insurance policies issued by several
primary insurance carriers and a number of excess carriers that have agreed to
provide coverage, subject to deductibles, exclusions, retentions and policy
limits. Litigation is pending against several excess insurance carriers seeking
damages and/or declaratory relief to secure their coverage obligations. Based on
the Company's experience in defending the claims to date and the amount of
insurance coverage available, the Company is of the opinion that the actions
should not ultimately have a material adverse effect on the financial position
or the results of operations of the Company.

     The Company was named, together with numerous other manufacturers of brand
name prescription drugs and certain companies that distribute brand name
prescription drugs, in suits in federal and state courts brought by various
groups of retail pharmacy companies. The federal cases consist principally of a
class action by retail pharmacies (including approximately 30 named plaintiffs)
(the "Federal Class Action"), as well as additional actions by approximately
3,500 individual retail pharmacies and a group of chain and supermarket
pharmacies (the "individual actions"). These cases, which were transferred to
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and
coordinated for pretrial purposes, allege that the defendant drug manufacturers
violated the Sherman Act by unlawfully agreeing with each other (and, as alleged
in some cases, with wholesalers) not to extend to retail pharmacy companies the
same discounts allegedly extended to mail order pharmacies, managed care
companies and certain other customers, and by unlawfully discriminating against
retail pharmacy companies by not extending them such

                                       22

<PAGE>

discounts. On November 15, 1994, the federal court certified a class (the
Federal Class Action) consisting of all persons or entities who, since October
15, 1989, bought brand name prescription drugs from any manufacturer or
wholesaler defendant, but specifically excluding government entities, mail order
pharmacies, HMOs, hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. Fifteen manufacturer
defendants, including the Company, agreed to settle the Federal Class Action
subject to court approval. The Company's share pursuant to an Agreement as of
January 31, 1996, was $31.25 million, payable in four annual installments
without interest. The Company continues to believe that there was no conspiracy
and specifically denied liability in the Settlement Agreement, but had agreed to
settle to avoid the monetary and other costs of litigation. The settlement was
filed with the Court on February 9, 1996 and went through preliminary and final
fairness hearings. By orders of April 4, 1996, the Court: (1) rejected the
settlement; (2) denied the motions of the manufacturers (including the Company)
for summary judgment; (3) granted the motions of the wholesalers for summary
judgment; and (4) denied the motion to exclude purchases by other than direct
purchasers. On August 15, 1997, the Court of Appeals (1) reversed the denial of
summary judgment for the manufacturers excluding purchases by other than direct
purchasers; (2) reversed the grant of summary judgment dismissing the
wholesalers; and (3) took action regarding Alabama state cases, and
DuPont-Merck. In May 1996, thirteen manufacturer defendants, including the
Company, entered into an Amendment to the Settlement Agreement which was filed
with the Court on May 6, 1996. The Company's financial obligations under the
Settlement Agreement were not increased. The Settlement Agreement, as amended,
received final approval on June 21, 1996. Appeals from this decision were
dismissed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in May 1997.
Trial began in September 1998 for the class case against the non-settlers, and
the District Court also permitted the opt-out plaintiffs to add the wholesalers
as named defendants in their cases. The District Court dismissed the case at the
close of the plaintiffs' evidence. The plaintiffs have appealed.

     Retail pharmacy cases have also been filed in state courts in Alabama,
California, Minnesota, Mississippi and Wisconsin. Pharmacy classes have been
certified in California. The Company's motion to dismiss was granted in the
Wisconsin case, and that dismissal is under appeal.

     Consumer class actions have been filed in Alabama, Arizona, California, the
District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York,
North Carolina, Tennessee, Washington and Wisconsin alleging injury to consumers
from the failure to give discounts to retail pharmacy companies. The New York
and Washington state cases were dismissed, and an appeal is pending in New York.
A case filed in Colorado state court was dismissed without appeal. A consumer
class has been certified in California, and a limited consumer class has been
certified in the District of Columbia. Class certification was denied in the
Michigan state case, and plaintiffs' subsequent petition for review was denied.
Class certification also was denied in the Maine case.

     In addition to its settlement of the retailer Federal Class Action (see
above), the Company has also settled several major opt-out retail cases, and
along with other manufacturers: (1) has entered into an agreement to settle all
outstanding consumer class actions (except Alabama and California), which
settlement is going through the approval process in the various courts in which
the actions are pending; and (2) has entered into an agreement to settle the
California consumer case.

     The Company believes that these brand name prescription drug antitrust
cases, which generally seek damages and certain injunctive relief, are without
merit.

     The Federal Trade Commission is conducting an investigation focusing on the
pricing practices at issue in the above pharmacy antitrust litigation. In July
1996, the Commission issued a subpoena for documents to

                                       23


<PAGE>

the Company, among others, to which the Company has responded. A second subpoena
was issued to the Company for documents in May 1997 and the Company has
responded. This investigation continues.

     FDA administrative proceedings relating to Plax are pending, principally an
industry-wide call for data on all anti-plaque products by the FDA. The call for
data notice specified that products that have been marketed for a material time
and to a material extent may remain on the market pending FDA review of the
data, provided the manufacturer has a good faith belief that the product is
generally recognized as safe and effective and is not misbranded. The Company
believes that Plax satisfied these requirements and prepared a response to the
FDA's request, which was filed on June 17, 1991. This filing, as well as the
filings of other manufacturers, is still under review and is currently being
considered by an FDA Advisory Committee. The Committee has issued a draft report
recommending that plaque removal claims should not be permitted in the absence
of data establishing efficacy against gingivitis. The process of incorporating
the Advisory Committee recommendations into a final monograph is expected to
take several years. If the draft recommendation is ultimately accepted in the
final monograph, although it would have a negative impact on sales of Plax, it
will not have a material adverse effect on the sales, financial position or
operations of the Company.

     On January 15, 1997, an action was filed in Circuit Court, Chambers County,
Alabama, purportedly on behalf of a class of consumers, variously defined by the
laws or types of laws governing their rights and encompassing residents of up to
47 states. The complaint alleges that the Company's claims for Plax were untrue,
entitling them to a refund of their purchase price for purchases since 1988. A
hearing on Plaintiffs' motion to certify the class was held on June 2, 1998. We
are awaiting the Court's decision. The Company believes the complaint is without
merit.

     The Federal Trade Commission conducted an investigation of the advertising
of Rid, which was resolved by a Consent Decree made final in December, 1998. At
the same time, the New York State Attorney General's office is investigating the
same or similar matters.

     Since December 1998, three actions have been filed in the state courts in
Houston, San Francisco, and Chicago, purportedly on behalf of statewide
(California) or nationwide (Houston and Chicago) classes of consumers who allege
that the Company's and other manufacturers' advertising and promotional claims
for RID and other pediculicides were untrue, entitling them to refunds, other
damages and/or injunctive relief. The Houston case has been removed to federal
court; no proceedings have yet occurred in the other cases. The Company believes
the complaints are without merit.

     In April 1996, the Company received a Warning Letter from the FDA relating
to the timeliness and completeness of required post marketing reports for
pharmaceutical products. The letter did not raise any safety issue about Pfizer
drugs. The Company has been implementing remedial actions designed to remedy the
issues raised in the letter. During 1997, the Company met with the FDA to
apprise them of the scope and status of these activities. A full examination of
the progress made by the Company in this area will occur in 1999.

     During 1998, the Company completed the sale of all of the businesses and
companies that were part of the Medical Technology Group ("MTG"). As part of the
sale provisions, the Company has retained responsibility for certain items
including matters related to the sale of MTG products sold by the Company before
the sale of the MTG businesses. A number of cases have been brought against
Howmedica Inc. (some of which also name the Company) alleging that P.C.A.
one-piece acetabular hip prostheses sold from 1983 through 1990 were defectively
designed and manufactured and pose undisclosed risks to implantees. The Company
believes that most if not all of these cases are without merit. Between 1994 and
1996, seven class actions alleging various injuries arising from implantable
penile prostheses manufactured by American Medical Systems 

                                       24

<PAGE>



were filed and ultimately dismissed or discontinued. Thereafter, between late 
1996 and early 1998, approximately 700 former members of one or more of the 
purported classes, represented by some of the same lawyers who filed the class 
actions, filed individual suits in Circuit Court in Minneapolis alleging damages
from their use of implantable penile prostheses. The Company believes that most
if not all of these cases are without merit.

     In June 1993, the Ministry of Justice of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil,
commenced a civil public action against the Company's Brazilian subsidiary,
Laboratorios Pfizer Ltda. ("Pfizer Brazil") asserting that during a period in
1991, Pfizer Brazil withheld sale of the pharmaceutical product Diabinese in
violation of antitrust and consumer protection laws. The action seeks the award
of moral, economic and personal damages to individuals and the payment to a
public reserve fund. On February 8, 1996, the trial court issued a decision
holding Pfizer Brazil liable. The award of damages to individuals and the
payment into the public reserve fund will be determined in a subsequent phase of
the proceedings. The trial court's opinion sets out a formula for calculating
the payment into the public reserve fund which could result in a sum of
approximately $88 million. The total amount of damages payable to eligible
individuals under the decision would depend on the number of persons eventually
making claims. Pfizer Brazil is appealing this decision. The Company believes
that this action is without merit and should not have a material adverse effect
on the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.

                            STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLAN
                          (AS AMENDED THROUGH 1/28/99)


1.       PURPOSE

         The purpose of the Stock and Incentive Plan (known as the "Stock Option
and Incentive Plan of 1965 as amended"  prior to the 1980 amendment  thereof and
hereinafter  called the "Plan") is to furnish a material  incentive to employees
of the Company and its  subsidiaries by making available to them the benefits of
a larger  Common  Stock  ownership  in the  Company  through  stock  options and
otherwise.  It is believed that these increased  incentives will not only induce
the continued service of employees but will also stimulate their efforts towards
the continued success of the Company and its subsidiaries,  as well as assist in
the  recruitment of new employees.  Nothing in the Plan shall  interfere with or
limit in any way the right of the Company or any  subsidiary  to  terminate  any
participant's  employment at any time, nor confer upon any participant any right
to continue in the employ of the Company or any  subsidiary.  No employee  shall
have the right to be  selected  to receive an option or other  award  under this
Plan or having been so selected,  to be selected to receive a future award grant
or option.  Neither  the award nor any  benefits  arising out of this Plan shall
constitute part of a participant's  employment  contract with the Company or any
subsidiary  and,  accordingly,  this  Plan  and the  benefits  hereunder  may be
terminated  at any time in the  sole and  exclusive  discretion  of the  Company
without  giving rise to liability  on the part of the Company or any  subsidiary
for severance payments.

2.       ADMINISTRATION

         Except to the extent  otherwise  provided  in Section 4 and Section 15,
the Plan shall be  administered  by the  Employee  Compensation  and  Management
Development   Committee,   which  shall  make,  in  its  sole  discretion,   all
determinations arising in the administration,  construction or interpretation of
the Plan  including  the right to construe  disputed or doubtful  Plan terms and
provisions,  and any such  determination  shall be conclusive and binding on all
persons, except as otherwise provided by law.

3.       TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES

"employee" by any governmental or judicial authority.

6.       TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS

         All options under the Plan shall be subject to the following  terms and
conditions:

         (a) Option Price. The option price per share shall be not less than the
fair  market  value of the Common  Stock on the date the option is  granted,  as
determined  by the  Committee in accordance  with  applicable  provisions of the
Internal   Revenue  Code  and  Treasury   Department   rulings  and  regulations
thereunder.

         (b) Number of Shares.  The option  shall  state the number of shares of
Common Stock covered thereby.

         (c) Payment. At the time of the exercise of the option the option price
shall be payable in cash and/or, if the option so provides,  in shares of Common
Stock  valued  at the  market  price at the time the  option is  exercised.  The
Committee may in its discretion  require or permit  payroll  deductions or other
suitable means to enable  optionees to accumulate  sufficient  funds to exercise
their options and pay the option price.

         (d) Term of Option.  A qualified option shall provide that it shall not
be  exercisable  after the expiration of five years from the date such option is
granted.  An  incentive  stock  option  shall  provide  that  it  shall  not  be
exercisable  after  the  expiration  of ten years  from the date such  option is
granted. A non-qualified option may be exercisable for a period greater than ten
years if so provided in the terms of the option.

         (e)  Exercise of Option.  No option may be  exercised  during the first
year of its  term or such  longer  period  as may be  specified  in the  option;
provided, however, in the event of a "Change of Control" of the Company, as that
term is defined  in  Section  11(e),  the Board


<PAGE>


                                       5


may in its discretion make any options that are not yet exercisable  immediately
exercisable,  and further  provided the Committee may in its discretion make any
options that are not yet exercisable  immediately exercisable in cases where (i)
an optionee's  employment is to be terminated due to a divestiture or downsizing
of a business,  (ii) in the case of a retiring  optionee who holds  options with
extended vesting provisions, or (iii) otherwise,  where the Committee determines
that such  action is  appropriate  to  prevent  inequities  with  respect  to an
optionee.  Thereafter,  an  optionee,  subject to the terms of the  option,  may
exercise  the option in whole at any time or in part from time to time either by
giving written notice thereof  addressed to the Treasurer of the Company,  or by
using other  methods of notice as the  Committee  shall  adopt,  specifying  the
number of shares to be purchased and  accompanied by payment of the option price
therefor.  In the event of death, the person  designated in the optionee's Will,
or in the absence of such designation,  the legal representative of an optionee,
or if a legal  representative  of the  optionee  has  not  been  appointed,  the
optionee's surviving spouse, may in like manner exercise the option provided the
same  was  exercisable  by the  optionee  at the  time of his  death,  but  such
privilege shall expire,  subject to Section 6(d) and 6(g) (iii) hereof, (i) with
respect to options  granted on or before  January 23, 1975, six months after the
death of the  optionee,  unless the option shall be amended to  substitute a one
year period for such six month  period or (ii) with  respect to options  granted
after  January 23,  1975,  one year after the death of the  optionee;  provided,
however,  in any event  that if the option is not  exercised  by the last day in
which it is exercisable,  the option shall be exercised and the proceeds paid to
the deceased optionee's estate.

         (f)  Outstanding  Options.  Any qualified  option  (referred to in this
paragraph as "new Qualified  Option") shall provide that it may not be exercised
while there is outstanding any qualified stock option or restricted stock option
which was granted to the  optionee to purchase  stock in the Company or a parent
or subsidiary corporation of the Company (as defined,  respectively, by sections
425(e)  and (f) of the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1954)  or in a  predecessor
corporation  of any of such  corporations,  before  the  granting  of  said  new
Qualified  Option.  This limitation on exercise shall not apply during such time
as such outstanding qualified or restricted options are to purchase Common Stock
and the option price  thereunder  (determined as of the date of grant of the new
option) is not more than the option price of the new Qualified Option.

         (g)  Termination  of Option.  The option,  to the extent not exercised,
shall  terminate  upon its  expiration as set forth in Section 6(d) hereof,  its
surrender as set forth in Section 11(c)  hereof,  or upon breach by the optionee
of any  provision of the option,  or when the optionee  ceases to be an employee
for  any  reason  including  retirement,  whichever  event  shall  first  occur;
provided, however, that with respect to options granted during and subsequent to
August 1997 which are  otherwise  exercisable  in  accordance  with Section 6(e)
hereof on the date of termination of employment, three months after the optionee
ceases to be an employee for any reason including  retirement,  however,  if the
option so provides,  the Committee in its  discretion may permit the optionee to
exercise  the  option  for  reasons  of  hardship  up  to  twelve  months  after
termination,  assuming that the option was otherwise exercisable; further except
that,  subject to Section 6(d) hereof (i) the  optionee,  if his  employment  is
terminated as a result of a disability,  and provided the option was exercisable


<PAGE>


                                       6


at the time of  termination  of  employment,  may elect to exercise  the option,
subject  to  Section  6(e)  hereof,  within  twelve  months  after  the  date of
termination,  (ii) in the event of his death while an employee, the option shall
terminate  as  provided  in  Section  6(e)  hereof,  and  (iii)  notwithstanding
subsections (i) and (ii) above, if the option so provides, in the event that the
optionee has retired or is eligible for retirement  under Sections 4a., b. or d.
of the  Company's  Retirement  Annuity  Plan, or as the same may be amended from
time to time, or under any pension or retirement  plan maintained by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries,  the optionee,  or in the event of death, the person
designated in the optionee's  Will, or in the absence of such  designation,  the
legal  representative  of such  optionee,  or if a legal  representative  of the
optionee has not been appointed,  the optionee's  surviving spouse, may elect to
exercise  the  option  at any time  until  such  option  expires  by its  terms;
provided,  however, in any event that if the option is not exercised by the last
day in which it is  exercisable,  the option shall be exercised and the proceeds
paid to the deceased  optionee's  estate;  any  subsequent  reemployment  of the
optionee by the Company shall not affect such  optionee's  right to exercise the
option as provided in this subsection (iii).

         (h) Recapitalization.  In the event of any change in the number or kind
of  outstanding   shares  of  Common  Stock  of  the  Company  by  reason  of  a
recapitalization,    merger,    consolidation,    reorganization,    separation,
liquidation,  stock split,  stock  dividend,  combination of shares or any other
change  in the  corporate  structure  or  shares  of  stock of the  Company,  an
appropriate adjustment will be made automatically, in accordance with applicable
provisions  of the Internal  Revenue Code and  Treasury  Department  rulings and
regulations  thereunder,  in the number and kind of shares for which options may
thereafter be granted both in the aggregate and as to each optionee,  as well as
in the number and kind of shares subject to options  theretofore granted and the
option price payable upon exercise of such options.

         (i)  Transferability.  The  option  shall  provide  that it will not be
transferable  by the  optionee  other  than by Will or the laws of  descent  and
distribution and shall be exercisable,  during the optionee's lifetime,  only by
him;  provided,  however,  that the  Committee in its  discretion  may grant (or
sanction  by way of an  amendment  to an  existing  grant)  non-qualified  stock
options which may be  transferred  by the  optionee,  solely as gifts during the
optionee's  lifetime,  to any member of the optionee's  immediate family or to a
trust  established  for the  exclusive  benefit  of one or more  members  of the
optionee's  immediate  family,  in which case the terms of such option  shall so
state. A transfer of an option  pursuant to this subjection may be effected only
by the Company at the written request of an optionee and shall become  effective
only when recorded in the Company's record of outstanding  options. In the event
an option is transferred as contemplated in this subsection, such option may not
be subsequently  transferred by the transferee other than by Will or the laws of
descent  and  distribution,  such  option  shall  continue to be governed by and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan and the relevant grant, and the
transferee  shall  be  entitled  to the same  rights  as the  optionee  as if no
transfer had taken place. As used in this subsection,  "immediate  family" shall
mean any spouse, child, stepchild or grandchild, and shall include relationships
arising from legal adoption.


<PAGE>


                                       7

         (j)  Applicable  Law. The option shall contain a provision  that it may
not be exercised  at a time when the exercise  thereof or the issuance of shares
thereunder  would  constitute a violation of any federal or state law or listing
requirements  of the New York Stock Exchange for such shares.  The provisions of
the Plan shall be construed, regulated and administered according to the laws of
the State of New York without  giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws,
except to the extent superseded by any controlling Federal statute.

         (k)  Incorporation  by Reference.  The option shall contain a provision
that all the applicable  terms and conditions of this Plan are  incorporated  by
reference therein.

         (l) Tandem  Award.  Any option  constituting  a part of a tandem  award
authorized by Section 10 hereof shall be subject to the terms and  conditions of
such award.

         (m) Other  Provisions.  The option shall contain such provisions as the
Committee  shall deem advisable  consistent with the terms of the Plan as herein
set forth.  In addition,  the qualified  stock  options and the incentive  stock
options  shall  contain  such other  provisions  as may be necessary to meet the
requirements of the Internal  Revenue Code and the Treasury  Department  rulings
and  regulations  issued  thereunder with respect to qualified stock options and
incentive stock options.

7.       STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

         The Committee may, in its discretion,  grant stock appreciation  rights
to the holder of any  qualified or  non-qualified  stock  option  granted by the
Company.  Such appreciation rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions
consistent  with the  Plan as the  Committee  shall  impose  from  time to time,
including the following:

         (a) An  appreciation  right may be made part of any such  option at the
time of its grant or at any time thereafter prior to its expiration;

         (b) Upon exercise of an appreciation right the holder shall be entitled
to receive:

                  (i) a number  of  shares of the  Common  Stock of the  Company
determined by dividing:

                           (1) the number of shares which the optionee  selects,
                           not to  exceed  the total  number of shares  that the
                           optionee is  eligible to purchase as of the  exercise
                           date  under the  related  option,  multiplied  by the
                           amount,  if any, by which the fair market  value of a
                           share  of the  Common  Stock  of the  Company  on the
                           exercise  date exceeds the option  price  provided in
                           the related option, by



<PAGE>

                                       8

                           (2) the fair  market  value of a share of the  Common
                           Stock of the Company on the exercise date;  provided,
                           however, that the total number of shares which may be
                           received  pursuant to the exercise of an appreciation
                           right  shall not  exceed  the total  number of shares
                           subject to the related option; or

                  (ii) if so provided in the award, (a) payment of cash equal to
                  the  aggregate  fair market value on the date of such exercise
                  of the  number  of shares of  Common  Stock  determined  under
                  clause  (i);  or (b) in part cash and in part  shares;  all as
                  determined by the Committee in its sole discretion;

         (c) No fractional share or cash in lieu thereof will be issued upon the
exercise of any such right; and

         (d)  Exercise  of an  appreciation  right,  in whole or in part,  shall
exhaust and  terminate  the related  option with respect to the number of shares
used  in the  calculation  under  subsection  (b)(i)(1)  of  this  Section  7 in
determining  the number of shares issued upon such exercise of the  appreciation
right (or which  would  have been  issued but for any cash  payment).  Upon such
exercise of an appreciation  right, the number of shares subject to reallocation
under Section 13 shall be equal to the  difference  between the number of shares
used in the  calculation  under  subsection  (b)(i)(1) of this Section 7 and the
number of shares  issued to the  optionee  pursuant to such  exercise  (or which
would have been issued but for any cash payment).

8.       STOCK AWARDS

         Stock  awards  will  consist of shares of Common  Stock of the  Company
issued to participating  employees as additional compensation for their services
to the Company.  Stock awards shall be subject to the  provisions  of Section 3,
this Section 8, Section 11(a),  (c) and (d) and,  during the period in which the
restrictions or the Company's right of reacquisition hereinafter referred to are
in effect,  Section 11(b).  Other than for stock awards determined in accordance
with the Company's Performance-Contingent Share Award Program and paid out under
this Plan, as to which there shall be no waiting  period,  each stock award to a
participant  shall  provide  that the  shares  subject  to such award may not be
transferred or otherwise  disposed of by the participant prior to the expiration
of a period or periods specified therein, which shall not occur earlier than one
year  following  the date of the award  (except  that the award may  permit  the
earlier lapse of such  restriction  in the event of the  participant's  death or
disability or retirement  pursuant to any pension or retirement  plan maintained
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries),  and that the Company shall have the
right to reacquire such shares upon termination of the participant's  employment
with the Company while such restriction is in effect,  such  reacquisition to be
upon the terms and conditions  provided in the award. Stock awards shall also be
subject to such other terms and conditions,  not inconsistent  therewith, as the
Committee determines to be appropriate.

9.       PERFORMANCE UNIT AWARDS

         Performance  unit awards will consist of performance  units credited to
participating  employees.  Each award shall  specify  the initial  value of each
performance unit, such value to be determined by reference to the book or market
value of the Common  Stock of the Company or to the  Company's  earnings or such
other  criteria  related to the Company's  performance as the Committee may deem
appropriate.  The award  shall be payable  in cash  and/or  Common  Stock of the
Company as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.

         Subject to the  provisions  of this  Section 9 and of  Section  11, the
Committee  shall have  exclusive  authority  to determine  additional  terms and
conditions  of each  performance  unit  award.  Such  terms and  conditions  may
include, without limitation, provisions under which:

         (1) On the payment date  prescribed  in the award a  participant  shall
become  entitled  to receive  the full value of each such unit on such date,  or
such other amount as such award may specify;

         (2) Each unit may accrue  earnings  determined by reference to earnings
per share or dividends paid per share on the Common Stock of the Company,  or to
the prime or another specified  lending rate, or to other criteria  specified in
the award and payable at such time or times as may be specified therein;

         (3) The right of a  participant  to  receive  payments  in respect of a
performance  unit  may be made  subject  in  whole  or in part to the  Company's
attainment of earnings or other objectives specified in the award; and

         (4)  The  determination  of  all  relevant  valuation  and  other  data
pertaining to the award shall be in the sole judgment of the Committee.  Without
limitation of the  foregoing,  in the event that an amount payable in respect of
an award is based  in  whole or in part on the  Company's  earnings  or the book
value of its  Common  Stock,  the  Committee  may make such  adjustments  to the
publicly reported amounts of the Company's consolidated earnings or of such book
value as it deems appropriate for changes in accounting practices or principles,
for  material   acquisitions  or   dispositions   of  stock  or  property,   for
recapitalizations  or  reorganizations  or for any other  events with respect to
which the Committee  determines such an adjustment to be appropriate in order to
avoid distortion in the operation of the Plan.

         Each award shall be evidenced by a written  instrument  which shall set
forth the number of performance units covered thereby,  the initial dollar value
of each such unit, the terms and conditions,  if any, under which such value may
change prior to the vesting of the unit,  the terms and  conditions  under which
each such unit will vest and such  other  matters as the  Committee  in its sole
discretion may deem  appropriate.  The Committee may from time to


<PAGE>


                                       10

time  establish  such  rules as it deems  appropriate  regarding  the manner and
timing of payments of amounts due in respect of vested units.

         No  performance   unit  award  shall  provide  for  the  vesting  in  a
participating  employee of any  performance  unit covered  thereby  prior to the
expiration of a period of one year after the date of the award,  except that the
award  may  provide  for such  vesting  in the event of death or  disability  or
retirement of the employee  pursuant to a pension or retirement  plan maintained
by the  Company  or one of its  subsidiaries  prior  to the  expiration  of such
period.  Each award shall provide that prior to the vesting of the units covered
thereby  they shall be subject to  forfeiture  (A) upon the  termination  of the
recipient's  employment  with the  Company,  (B) as  contemplated  by Section 10
hereof,  if such award is part of a tandem  award,  and (C) as may  otherwise be
specified in the award.

         No participant shall be entitled to receive in respect of a performance
unit payments of amounts exceeding twice the original value established for such
unit.

         The maximum  dollar value of  performance  units which may be initially
awarded  to  participants  may not  exceed  1,500,000  "Reference  Units" in the
aggregate  for  all  participants,  and  50,000  Reference  Units  for  any  one
participant. For purposes of this paragraph:

         (1) A Reference  Unit shall be the equivalent of the greater of (a) the
fair market value of one share of the Common Stock of the Company on the date as
of which a particular award of performance  units is made, or (b) the book value
of a share of such Common Stock as at the end of the last completed  fiscal year
of the Company prior to such award date plus the cash  dividends  paid per share
on such stock during such fiscal year; and

         (2)  Crediting  of an award of  performance  units  shall  exhaust  and
terminate a number of Reference  Units equal to the number  obtained by dividing
the  credited  dollar  value of such  performance  units by the  greater  of the
amounts  referred to in subclauses (a) and (b) of Clause 1 above,  and except as
provided in the following sentence, such terminated Reference Units shall not be
utilized for subsequent awards.

         In the event that an award of performance units is forfeited or for any
other  reason the cash amount or the value of the shares of the Common  Stock of
the Company (as  determined  by the Committee in its sole  judgment)  ultimately
delivered to a participant in payment for an award of  performance  units (other
than amounts paid to the  participant as earnings on the  performance  units) is
less than the  Reference  Units  originally  exhausted and  terminated  upon the
crediting of such award, a number of Reference  Units equal to the dollar amount
of such  shortfall  divided by the value  originally  assigned to such Reference
Units shall be restored and become  available  for  subsequent  awards under the
Plan.

         Nothing  contained  herein  shall be  deemed  to limit the right of the
Board of  Directors  or a duly  appointed  committee  thereof to  authorize  the
payment or award of compensation  other than in stock to any employee  otherwise
than  pursuant to the Plan,  regardless  of the fact


<PAGE>


                                       11

that a  particular  form of  compensation  may be the same as or similar to that
which the  Committee  may pay or award to  participants  under  Section 9 of the
Plan.

10.      TANDEM AWARDS

         The  Committee  may,  in  its   discretion,   grant  tandem  awards  to
participating  employees. A tandem award shall consist of a right of election by
the  employee  among  two or more of the  following:  (A) an  option,  which may
include a stock appreciation right with respect thereto,  (B) a performance unit
award,  and (C) a stock  award.  Subject to the  provisions  of Section 11, such
right of election  shall be upon such terms and  conditions as the Committee may
specify in the tandem award, which shall include the following:

         (a) The number of shares of the Common Stock of the Company  covered by
the  option,  the number of shares  covered by the stock award and the number of
performance units covered by the performance unit award;

         (b) Provisions  establishing the number of shares and performance units
which will remain  subject to each portion of the tandem award upon the exercise
of the right of election in whole or in part; and

         (c) The date on which  the right of  election  shall  terminate  unless
earlier exercised or terminated pursuant to the terms of the tandem award.

11.      CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL AWARDS

of  outstanding   shares  of  Common  Stock  of  the  Company  by  reason  of  a
recapitalization,    merger,    consolidation,    reorganization,    separation,
liquidation,  stock split,  stock  dividend,  combination of shares or any other
change  in the  corporate  structure  or  shares  of  stock of the  Company,  an
appropriate adjustment will be made automatically, in accordance with applicable
provisions  of the Internal  Revenue Code and  Treasury  Department  rulings and
regulations  thereunder,  in the number and kind of shares and performance units
subject to  Sections  8, 9 and 10 and the maximum  dollar  value of  performance
units subject to Sections 9 and 10.

         (b) Transferability.  Each award to a participant under Section 8, 9 or
10  shall  provide  that  neither  the  award  nor any  right or  interest  of a
participant  therein shall be transferable by the participant other than by Will
or the  laws  of  descent  and  distribution,  and  that  such  award  shall  be
exercisable, during the participant's lifetime, only by him.

         (c)  Surrender.  The  Committee may require the surrender of an option,
stock  appreciation  right,  stock award or performance unit award granted under
this  Plan  as  a  condition  precedent  to  a  grant  of a  new  option,  stock
appreciation  right,  stock  award


<PAGE>


                                       12

or performance unit award for the same or a different number of shares or having
the same or a different  initial value in Reference  Units as the option,  stock
appreciation right, stock award or performance unit award surrendered;  provided
that a qualified option or incentive stock option which is so surrendered shall,
solely for the provisions of Section 6(f) hereof, be deemed to be an outstanding
qualified  option or incentive  stock option  until such  surrendered  qualified
option or  incentive  stock  option would have expired by reason of the lapse of
time,  notwithstanding  the fact that it had been  surrendered and was no longer
exercisable.   Such  new  option,  stock  appreciation  right,  stock  award  or
performance unit award shall be subject to the terms or conditions  specified by
the Committee at the time the new option,  stock appreciation right, stock award
or  performance  unit award is granted,  all  determined in accordance  with the
provisions of this Plan without regard to the price, period of exercise,  or any
other terms or conditions of the option,  stock appreciation  right, stock award
or performance unit award surrendered.

         (d) Leave of  Absence.  If  approved by the  Committee,  an  employee's
absence or leave  because of military or  governmental  service,  disability  or
other reason shall not be  considered  an  interruption  of  employment  for any
purpose of the Plan.

         (e) Change of Control shall mean the occurrence of any of the following
events: (a) at any time during the two-year period following the Effective Date,
or the  beginning  of a renewal  term as the case may be, at least a majority of
the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  shall  cease  to  consist  of  "Continuing
Directors"  (meaning  directors of the Company who either were  directors at the
beginning of such two-year period or who subsequently became directors and whose
election, or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, was approved
by a majority of the then Continuing Directors);  or (b) any "person" or "group"

and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") Regulation 13d-3) of shares of Common Stock of
the Company having 20% or more of the voting power of all outstanding  shares of
capital stock of the Company,  unless such acquisition is approved by a majority
of  the  directors  of  the  Company  in  office   immediately   preceding  such
acquisition;  or (c) a merger or consolidation  occurs to which the Company is a
party,  whether  or not the  Company  is the  surviving  corporation,  in  which
outstanding  shares of Common Stock of the Company are converted  into shares of
another  company (other than a conversion  into shares of voting common stock of
the successor  corporation or a holding company thereof  representing 80% of the
voting power of all capital  stock  thereof  outstanding  immediately  after the
merger or  consolidation)  or other securities (of either the Company or another
company) or cash or other  property;  or (d) the sale of all,  or  substantially

                                   APPENDIX A


                RULES OF THE PFIZER INC STOCK AND INCENTIVE PLAN
                             FOR EMPLOYEES IN FRANCE


1.       INTRODUCTION

         The Pfizer Inc Stock and Incentive Plan  (hereinafter the "Plan" or the
"U.S. Plan") specifically authorizes the Committee to establish rules applicable
to options granted under the U.S. Plan,  including  options granted to employees
in France,  as the Committee deems advisable.  The Committee has determined that
it is advisable to  establish a sub-plan  for the  purposes of  permitting  such
options to qualify for  favorable  local tax and social  security  treatment  in
France.  Therefore,  the Company now establishes a sub-plan of the U.S. Plan for
the purpose of granting  options  which qualify for the favorable tax and social
security  treatment in France  applicable  to options granted  under the Law no.
70-1322 of December 31, 1970, as subsequently  amended, to qualifying  employees
who are resident in France for French tax purposes.  The terms of the U.S. Plan,
of which this sub-plan is a part,  shall  constitute the Company's  stock option
plan for French  Employees  (the  "French  Plan").  Under the French  Plan,  the
qualifying employees will be granted only stock options. In no case will they be
granted  substitute  awards,  e.g.,  stock  bonuses,   restricted  stock,  stock
appreciation rights or other similar awards.

2.       DEFINITIONS

         Terms used in the French Plan shall have the same meanings as set forth
         in the U.S. Plan.

         In addition, the term "Option" shall have the following meaning:

         a.      Purchase options, that are rights to acquire shares repurchased
                 by the Company  prior to the grant of said options; or

         b.      Subscription options, that are rights to subscribe newly issued
                 shares.

         The term "Grant Date" shall be the date on which the Committee both (a)
designates the optionee and (b) specifies the terms and conditions of the Option
including the number of shares and the Option price.

         The term "Exercise  Eligibility  Date" shall mean the fifth anniversary
of the Grant Date.



<PAGE>


                                       16

3.       ENTITLEMENT TO PARTICIPATE

         Any  salaried  employee  or  corporate  executive  in  France  shall be
eligible to receive  options  under the French Plan provided that he or she also
satisfies the eligibility conditions of the U.S. Plan. Options may not be issued
under the French Plan to  employees or  executives  owning more than ten percent
(10%) of the Company's capital shares or to individuals other than employees and
corporate  executives of a French subsidiary of the Company.  Options may not be
issued to  directors  of a French  subsidiary  unless they are  employed by such
subsidiary.

4.       CONDITIONS OF THE OPTION/OPTION PRICE

         Notwithstanding  any provision in the U.S.  Plan to the  contrary,  the
conditions of the Options (option price, number of underlying shares and vesting
period)  will not be  modified  after the grant date,  except as provided  under
Section 6 of the French  Plan.  In this  respect,  Options will not be repriced,
re-granted, nor will the time at which Options may be exercised be accelerated.

         The option price per share of common stock payable  pursuant to options
issued  hereunder  shall be fixed by the  Committee  on the date the  option  is
granted,  but in no event  shall  the  option  price  per share be less than the
greater of:

         a.    with  respect to  purchase  options  over the common  stock,  the
               higher  of  either  80% of the  average  quotation  price of such
               common  stock  during  the  20  days  of  quotation   immediately
               preceding  the grant date or 80% of the  average  purchase  price
               paid for such common stock by the Company;


         b.    with respect to subscription  options over the common stock,  80%
               of the average quotation price of such common stock during the 20
               days of quotation immediately preceding the grant date; and

         c.   the minimum option exercise price permitted under the U.S. Plan.

5.       EXERCISE OF AN OPTION

         Upon exercise of an option,  the full option price will have to be paid
either by check or  credit  transfer.  The  optionee  may also give  irrevocable
instructions  to a  stockbroker  to  properly  deliver  the option  price to the
Company.

         The shares  acquired  upon exercise of an option will be recorded in an
account  in the name of the  shareholder,  or if the shares are held by a broker
after exercise, in an account in the name of the shareholder with the broker.


<PAGE>


                                       17

         No Option  can be  exercised  before  the  Exercise  Eligibility  Date.
However,  in the case of  death of an  optionee,  outstanding  options  shall be
immediately  vested and exercisable  under the conditions set forth by Section 7
of the French Plan.

6.       CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION

         In  compliance  with French law, the option price shall not be modified
during the option's duration. Adjustments to the option exercise price or number
of shares  subject to an option issued  hereunder  shall be made to preclude the
dilution or enlargement of benefits under such option only in the case of one or
more of the following transactions by the Company:

      a.   an increase of corporate capital by cash contribution;

      b.   an issuance of convertible or exchangeable bonds;

      c.   a capitalization of retained earnings, profits, or issuance premiums;

      d.   a distribution of retained earnings by payment in cash or shares; and

      e.   a reduction of corporate capital by set off against losses.

7.       DEATH

         In the event of the death of a French optionee, said individual's heirs
may exercise the option within six months following the death, provided that any
option which remains  unexercised  shall expire six months following the date of
the optionee's death.

8.       INTERPRETATION

         It is intended that options granted under the French Plan shall qualify
for the favorable tax and social security treatment  applicable to stock options
granted under the Law no. 70-1322 of December 31, 1970, as subsequently amended,
and in accordance  with the relevant  provisions set forth by French tax law and
the French tax administration. The terms of the French Plan shall be interpreted
accordingly and in accordance  with the relevant  provisions set forth by French
tax and social  security  laws,  as well as the  French tax and social  security
administrations.

9.       AMENDMENTS

         Subject to the terms of the U.S. Plan, the Committee reserves the right
to amend or terminate the French Plan at any time.

                           are Relevant Emoluments.

         In  calculating  the limits  stated  above and the Market  Value,  sums

                     SUMMARY OF PFIZER ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN

The Annual  Incentive  Plan  ("AIP")  was  established  to provide a direct link
between  pay and  performance,  thereby  supporting  increased  overall  Company
performance through increased  individual  performance.  The purposes of the AIP
are to help  motivate  employees  and  attract  and retain the  highest  quality
workforce.

Management  selects AIP participants,  including  executive officers who are not
members of the Corporate Management Committee, and, in its discretion,  sets the
bonus potential for each participant based on level of responsibility within the
Company.  Annual  incentive  awards are based on an evaluation of either or both
individual and Company performance against quantitative and qualitative measures
and are subject to  approval  by senior  management  and,  if  appropriate,  the
Employee  Compensation  and  Management  Development  Committee or the Executive
Compensation Committee.

Amounts  paid  to  employees  constitute  part  of the  employee's  annual  cash
compensation.

                   this Section  4.2(c) is subject to the  provisions of Section
                   7.3(d) hereof."

                  2.5 Section 7.3(d) shall be amended to read in its entirety as

                   thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the
                   following provisions of this Section 7.3(d),  Purchaser shall
                   not  be  required  to  borrow   funds  under  the   Financing

                    Purchaser in writing (the "Arrangers' Notice") that pursuant
                    to the Financing  Commitment  Letter,  they have  determined
                    that changes in the tranche  amounts or interest rate margin
                    are  necessary  and such changes cause the weighted  average
                    Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin determined as set forth in
                    the  Financing  Commitment  Letter on the credit  facilities
                    (including the  refinancing of the Japanese Yen  denominated
                    indebtedness  in the  amount of  approximately  $75  million
                    provided  for  therein)  to exceed  3.05 per cent per annum.
                    Purchaser  will  keep  Pfizer  informed  of  the  status  of
                    discussions  regarding  pricing  of the loans from and after
                    the date hereof and will notify Pfizer of its receipt of any
                    Arrangers'  Notice  within 24 hours and will provide  Pfizer
                    with a copy  thereof  and the  calculation  of the  weighted
                    average   Applicable    Eurodollar   Rate   Margin   and   a
                    determination  of the amount  thereof  that exceeds 3.05 per
                    cent per annum (such amount in excess of 3.05 per cent being
                    referred to as the "Maximum Excess Margin").  In such event,
                    Pfizer  shall  have the right (but not the  obligation),  by
                    notice  to  Purchaser  within 2  Business  Days of  Pfizer's
                    receipt  of any  Arrangers'  Notice,  to  elect  to bear and
                    reimburse  Purchaser on a quarterly basis an amount equal to
                    the portion of the weighted  average  Applicable  Eurodollar
                    Rate Margin which  accrued on the credit  facilities  during
                    that quarter that exceeds 3.05 per cent per annum, but in no
                    event shall Pfizer be responsible  for more than the Maximum
                    Excess  Margin.  If Pfizer  makes such  election,  Purchaser
                    shall be required  to borrow the funds  under the  Financing
                    Commitment  Letter unless the Maximum  Excess Margin exceeds
                    .25 per  cent,  in which  case  Purchaser  may  elect not to
                    borrow the funds  regardless of whether  Pfizer has made the
                    election  referred  to  above.  Within 15 days of the end of
                    each quarter,  Purchaser  will provide Pfizer with a written
                    statement of the amounts  outstanding  under each tranche of
                    the credit  facilities during the quarter and the Applicable
                    Eurodollar  Rate Margins  together with a calculation of the
                    weighted average  Applicable  Eurodollar Rate Margin accrued
                    during such  quarter and the amount  payable by Pfizer under
                    this  Section  7.3(d).  Pfizer  shall  pay  such  amount  to
                    Purchaser   within  5  Business  Days  of  receipt  of  such
                    statement from the Purchaser. Pfizer shall have no liability
                    to reimburse Purchaser for any additional interest which may
                    result  from  any  changes  in or  waivers  of the  terms of
                    payment under the credit facilities provided pursuant to the
                    Financing  Commitment  Letter after Pfizer's  election under
                    this Section 7.3(d) has been made,  whether such  additional
                    interest  results as a  consequence  of changes in  interest
                    rates  or  spreads,  refinancing,  default,  changes  in the
                    amounts  and timing of payments or  otherwise  (whether  any
                    such change is permitted by the original terms of the credit
                    agreement or results from subsequent modifications agreed to
                    by the lenders and Purchaser)."

                  Section 3.  REFERENCES.  All references to "this Agreement" 
                  in the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement shall mean the Stock
                  and Asset Purchase Agreement as amended hereby.

                  Section 4.  GOVERNING LAW.  This Amendment shall be governed 
                  by the laws of the State of New York, its rules of conflict 
                  of laws notwithstanding.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

OVERVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS

In 1998, total revenues grew 23% to $13,544 million, reflecting the strong
worldwide demand for our in-line products as well as our copromoted products and
the introduction of two major products--Trovan and Viagra. We achieved net
income growth of 51% to $3,351 million for 1998. The following are reflected in
our 1998 results:

 o   the sale of our Medical Technology Group (MTG) businesses and the combining
     of our pharmaceutical and consumer health care businesses

 o   substantial investments in product support and research and development
     (R&D)

 o   the recording of charges associated with adjustments to asset values, the
     exiting of certain product lines, plant rationalizations, severance
     payments, copromotion payments to Searle and a contribution to The Pfizer
     Foundation

     Accompanying financial data for all periods present MTG as discontinued
operations.

TOTAL REVENUES

Total revenues increased $2,489 million in 1998 and $1,191 million in 1997.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total revenues grew by 26% in 1998 and
16% in 1997. These increases were primarily due to higher sales volume of our
products and revenue generated from product alliances (alliance revenue).

Pfizer Inc and Subsidiary Companies

PHARMACEUTICAL revenues increased 26% to $12,230 million in 1998 and 13% to
$9,726 million in 1997. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, pharmaceutical
revenues increased 29% in 1998 and 16% in 1997. These changes reflect the
strengthening of the dollar relative to the Japanese yen, as well as several
European and other Asian currencies. In the U.S. market, growth was 38% in 1998
and 17% in 1997, while international growth was 10% in 1998 and 8% in 1997. The
introduction of Viagra accounts for 12% of the 1998 U.S.
growth.

     Our major pharmaceutical products grew 28% in 1998. These
products--Norvasc, Procardia XL, Cardura, Diflucan, Zithromax, Trovan, Zoloft,
Viagra, Glucotrol XL and Zyrtec--comprised 82% of worldwide pharmaceutical net
sales. These products have U.S. patent expirations ranging from 2000 to 2011.

     Two new pharmaceuticals, Lipitor and Aricept, were launched in 1997 through
product alliances. Lipitor is a cholesterol-lowering medication developed by the
Parke-Davis Division of Warner-Lambert Company. Aricept is used to treat
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and was developed by Eisai Co., Ltd. These
alliances allow us to copromote or license these products for sale in certain
countries. Under the copromotion agreements, these products are marketed and
promoted with our alliance partners. We provide cash, staff and other resources
to sell, market, promote and further develop these products. Revenue from
copromotion agreements is reported in the Statement of Income as Alliance
revenue. Certain alliance agreements include quid-pro-quo provisions which would
give our product alliance partners the right to copromote one of our products.

     Rebates under Medicaid and related state programs reduced revenues by $150
million in 1998, $99 million in 1997 and $92 million in 1996. The 1998 increase
in rebates reflects growth of in-line products and the introduction of two
products--Trovan and Viagra. We also provided to the federal government
legislatively mandated discounts of $105 million in 1998, $88 million in 1997
and $87 million in 1996. Performance-based contracts also provide rebates to
several customers and have reduced total revenue in the U.S. Volume increases in
all three years more than offset these revenue reductions.

     ANIMAL HEALTH net sales decreased 1% in 1998 due to a weak livestock market
in the U.S. and poor Asian economies. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange,
net sales increased 3%. Animal health net sales increased 9% in 1997, reflecting
growth of several products. In 1997, sales of companion animal products
increased 14% and sales of products for food animals increased 7%. Sales of
Dectomax, an antiparasitic medication for livestock, grew 58% to $150 million in
1997.

     In December 1998, the Council of European Agricultural Ministers voted to
ban Stafac (virginiamycin), an antibacterial for poultry and swine used in
animal feed, throughout the European Union after June 30, 1999. We have filed
suit against the European Union, seeking reversal of the agricultural ministers'
decision. We believe the decision to ban Stafac disregarded the view of the
European Community Commission's own Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition
that the use of this product in animal feed posed no threat to human health.
Total 1998 sales of Stafac in Western Europe were $24 million. We do not expect
any ban on sales of virginiamycin to have a material effect on future results of
our operations.

     On January 28, 1999, the FDA's Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory
Committee recommended the approval of Tikosyn for use in the treatment of heart
rhythm disorders.

     We received a non-approvable letter from the FDA for Zeldox in 1998. We are
undertaking additional clinical work on this product to answer questions from
the FDA.

     In December 1998, G.D. Searle & Co. (Searle), the pharmaceutical division
of Monsanto Company, received approval from the FDA to market Celebrex for the
relief of symptoms of adult osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. We will
copromote Celebrex worldwide except in Japan. In February 1999, we launched
Celebrex with Searle. We are also participating with Searle in ongoing clinical
trials of Celebrex for additional indications, including Alzheimer's disease and
colon cancer and of a second-generation compound, valdecoxib.

     Ongoing or planned clinical trials for additional uses for existing
products as well as new product development programs include:

  o  Norvasc--for the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure

     Sixty-five other compounds are in early-stage development.

     We entered into worldwide agreements with Hoechst Marion Roussel AG
(Hoechst) to manufacture insulin and codevelop and copromote inhaled insulin.
Under the agreements, Hoechst and Pfizer will contribute expertise in the
development and production of insulin products as well as selling and marketing
resources. We bring to the alliance our development of inhaled insulin from our
collaboration with Inhale Therapeutic Systems, Inc. We plan to build a new
insulin manufacturing plant in Frankfurt, Germany, which will be jointly owned
with Hoechst, to support the product currently in development.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

In 1998, we recorded charges for asset impairment and restructuring. These
pre-tax charges were recorded in the Statement of Income as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(millions of dollars)              Total      COS*     SI&A*      R&D      OD*
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Asset impairments                   $213       $18     $ --       $ --    $195
Restructuring charges                177        68       17          1      91

*COS -- COST OF SALES; SI&A -- SELLING, INFORMATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
EXPENSES; OD -- OTHER DEDUCTIONS-NET.

     We recorded an impairment charge of $110 million in the pharmaceutical
segment to adjust intangible asset values, primarily goodwill and trademarks,
related to consumer health care product lines.

     These charges are a result of significant changes in the marketplace and a
revision of our strategies, including:

  o  the decision to redeploy resources from personal care and minor brands to
     over-the-counter switches of prescription products

  o  the withdrawal of one of our major over-the-counter products in Italy

  o  an acquired product line which experienced declines in market share

     As noted in our discussion of revenues, our animal health antibiotic feed
additive, Stafac, was banned throughout the European Union, resulting in asset
impairment charges of $103 million ($85 million was to adjust intangible asset
values, primarily goodwill and trademarks, and $18 million was to adjust the
carrying value of machinery and equipment in the pharmaceutical segment).

     These events have caused the projected undiscounted cash flows of a number
of our consumer health care product lines and Stafac to be less than their
carrying value. As a result, we lowered the carrying value of the
above-mentioned assets to their estimated fair value.

     The components of the restructuring charges follow:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(millions of dollars)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Property, plant and equipment                                     $ 49
Write-down of intangibles                                           44
Employee termination costs                                          40
Other                                                               44
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total                                                             $177
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     These charges resulted from a current review of our global operations to
increase efficiencies and return on assets, thereby resulting in plant and
product line rationalizations. In addition to the disposition of our MTG
businesses, we have exited, or plan to exit by the end of 1999, certain product
lines including those associated with certain of our livestock external
parasiticides and feed businesses. Also, we have decided to exit certain of our
fermentation operations.

     We have written off assets related to the product lines we are exiting,
including inventory, intangible assets--primarily goodwill--as well as certain
buildings, machinery and equipment for which we have no plans to use or sell. We
have begun to seek buyers for other properties which have been written down to
their estimated fair value. We will either dispose of or abandon these
properties by the end of 1999.

     As a result of the restructuring, the work force will be reduced by 520
manufacturing, sales and corporate personnel. Notifications to personnel have
been made. At December 31, 1998, 134 employees had been terminated. We will
complete terminations of the remaining personnel by December 31, 1999. Employee
termination costs represent payments for severance, outplacement counseling
fees, medical and other benefits and a $5 million noncash charge for the
acceleration of nonvested employee stock options.

     Other restructuring charges consist of charges for inventory for product
lines we have exited--$12 million, contract termination payments--$9 million,
facility closure costs--$7 million and environmental remediation costs
associated with the disposal of certain facilities--$16 million.


                                                                              31

     Restructuring charges of $90 million are reflected in the pharmaceutical
segment and $87 million are in the animal health segment.

     As a result of the asset write-downs and the exiting of certain product
lines, we expect a reduction in annual revenues of $71 million and a realization
of annual cost savings of $67 million, of which $11 million represents a
reduction in amortization and depreciation expense.

     COST OF SALES increased 18% in 1998 as compared with 5% in 1997. Excluding
the 1998 asset impairments and restructuring charges, cost of sales increased
13%. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales, excluding the 1998 asset
impairments and restructuring charges, declined to 15.8% in 1998 and 16.5% in
1997 from 17.2% in 1996. These declines largely reflect:


  o  a more favorable business and product mix

  o  productivity improvements 

     SI&A increased 27% in 1998 as compared with 14% in 1997. This increase
reflects a substantial global investment in our pharmaceutical selling efforts.
These efforts included the expansion of our sales forces in the U.S. and key
international markets. Recent additions to our U.S. sales force include a new
primary-care sales force, a specialty sales force dedicated largely to
rheumatology and the expansion of other specialty sales forces in the U.S.

     R&D expenses increased 26% in 1998 and 15% in 1997. These expenditures were
necessary to support the advancement of potential drug candidates in all stages
(from initial discovery through final regulatory approval). Pharmaceutical R&D
expenses, as a percentage of pharmaceutical revenues, averaged 17% over the last
three years.

     OTHER DEDUCTIONS -- NET increased substantially in 1998 as compared to a
minor decrease in 1997. This increase was primarily due to:

  o  asset impairments -- $195 million

  o  restructuring charges -- $91 million 

  o  copromotion payments to Searle for rights to Celebrex-- $240 million 

  o  a contribution to The Pfizer Foundation -- $300 million

  o  legal settlements involving the brand-name prescription drug antitrust
     litigation -- $57 million, partially offset by

  o  an increase in interest income on the investment of cash generated from
     operations and the divestiture of MTG

  o foreign exchange effects

      $1,036         $1,340         $1,567      $1,805        $2,279


Research and devel-
opment expenses
have increased at a 
compound annual
growth rate of 21%
over the past 5 years.



     Our overall EFFECTIVE TAX RATE increased from 28.0% in 1997 to 35.4% in
1998. This increase was due mainly to a higher tax rate on the gain on the
disposal of discontinued operations. The effective tax rate for continuing
operations decreased from 27.0% in 1997 to 24.8% in 1998. This decrease was
partially due to the extension to June 30, 1999 of the R&D tax credit in the
U.S. as well as to the tax benefit associated with the 1998 charges for asset
impairment, restructuring, copromotion payments to Searle and the contribution
to The Pfizer Foundation.

     The effective tax rate for continuing operations decreased from 30.0% in
1996 to 27.0% in 1997. This decrease was mainly due to the favorable changes in
the mix of income by country, partially offset by the continuing reduction of
tax benefits from our operations in Puerto Rico as a result of the enactment of
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the elimination of the tax
exemption on Puerto Rican investment income.

     We have received and are protesting assessments from the Belgian tax
authorities. For additional details, see note 8, "Taxes on Income," beginning on
page 50.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

During 1998, we exited the medical devices business with the sale of our
remaining MTG businesses:

  o  Howmedica to Stryker Corporation in December for $1.65 billion in cash

  o  Schneider to Boston Scientific Corporation in September for $2.1 billion in
     cash

  o  American Medical Systems to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co., LLC in September
     for $130 million in cash

  o  Valleylab to U.S. Surgical Corporation in January for $425 million  in cash


     The net proceeds from these divestitures have been or will be used for
general corporate purposes including the repayment of commercial paper
borrowings. Net income of these businesses up to the date of their divestiture
and divestiture gains are included in DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS--NET OF TAX.

NET INCOME

Net income for 1998 increased 51% over 1997. Diluted earnings per share were
$2.55 and increased by 50% over 1997. Income from continuing operations (net
income after adjustment for discontinued operations) adjusted to add back
certain significant charges increased by 26.6% over net income in 1997. On the
same basis, diluted earnings per share were $2.00 and increased by 25.8% over
1997. The 1998 pre-tax significant charges related to:

  o  asset impairments -- $213 million

  o  restructuring charges -- $177 million

  o  copromotion payments to Searle -- $240 million

  o  contribution to The Pfizer Foundation -- $300 million

  o  other, which is primarily related to legal settlements-- $126 million

The change in working capital from 1997 to 1998 was primarily due to the
following:

   INCREASES IN:
  O  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS--due to the receipt of
     cash from the MTG divestiture

  o  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE--due to the alliance revenue receivables and growth in
     sales volume

  o  INVENTORY--due to higher pharmaceutical inventory levels as a result of new
     products

  o  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS--due to an increase in funding for common stock
     purchases at a higher average price net of repayments made with cash
     received from the MTG divestiture

  o  DIVIDENDS PAYABLE--related to the first-quarter 1999 dividend declared in
     December 1998

  o  INCOME TAXES PAYABLE--primarily due to changes in operations and the
     divestiture of the MTG businesses

  o  OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES--primarily due to accrued charges associated with
     the divestiture of the MTG businesses and our plan to exit certain product
     lines

     DECREASE IN NET ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS--due to the sale of the
MTG businesses

The increase in working capital from 1996 to 1997 was primarily due to the
following:

INCREASES IN:
  O  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE--due in part to the alliance revenue receivables as
     well as higher sales volumes

  o  INVENTORY--due to higher pharmaceutical inventory levels for new products

DECREASES IN:
  o  Short-term loans--primarily due to the renewal of short-term loans as loans
     with maturities beyond one year

  o  Income taxes payable--primarily due to the settlements of tax-related
     contingencies

     The increase in shareholders' equity per common share in 1998 and 1997, as
well as the decrease in the 1997 percentage of debt to total capitalization was
primarily due to growth in net income.

 SUMMARY OF CASH FLOWS

Operations in 1998 provided significant cash inflows. Commercial paper and
short-term borrowings supplement operating cash flows.

  and cash equivalents              $   675   $ (273)  $  747
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES increased in 1998 primarily due
to:

  o  the inclusion of charges associated with asset impairments and
     restructuring in 1998 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

  o  higher taxes payable associated with sales growth of existing and new
     products as well as the MTG divestitures, partially offset by tax benefits
     associated with charges for asset impairment, restructuring, copromotion
     payments to Searle and the contribution to The Pfizer Foundation


  o  higher compensation related accruals, reduced by

  o  higher receivable and inventory levels related to new products

     Cash flows from operating activities decreased in 1997 as the growth in
income from continuing operations was offset by an increase in accounts
receivable and inventories.

     NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES changed in 1998 primarily due to:

  o  proceeds from the sale of the MTG businesses, some of which accounts for
     our increase in short-term investments, reduced by

  o  increased long-term investments and capital expenditures 

     Net cash used in investing activities changed in 1997 largely due to the:

  o  increase in capital expenditures

  o  decrease in proceeds from the sale of businesses

  o  absence of business acquisitions in 1997

     In 1999,  additions to  property,  plant and  equipment  are expected to be
approximately $1.5 billion.

     NET CASH USED IN  FINANCING  ACTIVITIES  increased in 1998 and 1997 largely
due to the effects of:

  o  the increase in common stock  purchases at a higher average price

  o  higher dividend payments to our shareholders, reduced by

  o  more cash received from employee stock option exercises

     In September 1998, we completed a program under which we purchased 26.4
million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $2 billion. In that same
month, the Board of Directors approved a new share-purchase program with
authorization to purchase up to $5 billion of our company's common stock. Under
the new program, we purchased approximately 4.9 million shares in the open
market for approximately $525 million in the fourth quarter of 1998. Purchased
shares are available for general corporate purposes.

     We have available lines of credit and revolving-credit agreements with a
select group of banks and other financial intermediaries. Major unused lines of
credit totaled approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 1998.

     Our short-term debt has been rated P1 by Moody's Investors Services
(Moody's) and A1+ by Standard and Poor's (S&P). Also, our long-term debt has
been rated Aaa by Moody's and AAA by S&P for the past 13 years. Moody's and S&P
are the major corporate debt-rating organizations and these are their highest
ratings.

The 1998 cash
dividends paid
represented the 31st
consecutive year of
dividend increases.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK

Our dividend payout ratio, which represents cash dividends paid per common share
divided by diluted earnings per common share amounted to 29.8% in 1998 and 40.0%
in both 1997 and 1996. Excluding the effects on net income of discontinued
operations and charges for asset impairment, restructuring, copromotion payments
to Searle and the contribution to The Pfizer Foundation, the dividend payout
ratio was 38.0% in 1998. In December 1998, the Board of Directors declared a
first-quarter 1999 dividend of $.22, an increase of 16% over the $.19 per share
dividend declared and paid in each quarter of 1998. This marked the 32nd
consecutive year of quarterly dividend increases.

BANKING OPERATION

Our international banking operation, Pfizer International Bank Europe (PIBE),
operates under a full banking license from the Central Bank of Ireland. The
results of its operations are included in OTHER DEDUCTIONS--NET.

     PIBE extends credit to financially strong borrowers, largely through U.S.
dollar loans made primarily for short and medium terms, with floating interest
rates. Generally, loans are made on an unsecured basis. When deemed appropriate,
guarantees and certain covenants may be obtained as a condition to the extension
of credit.

     To reduce credit risk, PIBE has established credit approval guidelines,
borrowing limits and monitoring procedures. Credit risk is further reduced
through an active policy of diversification with respect to borrower, industry
and geographic location. PIBE continues to have S&P's highest short-term rating
of A1+.

     The net income of PIBE is affected by changes in market interest rates
because of repricing and maturity mismatches between its interest-sensitive
assets and liabilities. PIBE is currently asset sensitive (more assets than
liabilities repricing in a given period) and, therefore, we expect that in an
environment of decreasing interest rates, net income would decline. PIBE's asset
and liability management reflects its liquidity, interest-rate outlook and
general market conditions.

     For additional details regarding our banking operation, see note 3,
"Financial Subsidiaries," on page 45.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION AND
FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose
forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's
future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This annual report and
other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such
forward-looking statements that set out anticipated results based on
management's plans and assumptions. We have tried, wherever possible, to
identify such statements by using words such as "anticipate," "estimate,"
"expects," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes" and words and terms of
similar substance in connection with any discussion of future operating or
financial performance.

     We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized,
although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions.
Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate
assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or
should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary
materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear
this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements. We undertake no
obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.

     Certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions are discussed here and under
the heading entitled "Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results" in Item
1 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998, which
will be filed at the end of March 1999.


                                                                              35


<PAGE>


Pfizer Inc and Subsidiary Companies


Prior to the filing of Form 10-K, you should refer to the discussion under the
same heading in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 27, 1998, and to the extent incorporated by reference therein, in our
Form 10-K filing for 1997. This discussion of potential risks and uncertainties
is by no means complete but is designed to highlight important factors that may
impact our outlook.

COMPETITION AND THE HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT
In the U.S., many of our pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing price
pressures as managed care organizations, institutions and government agencies
seek price discounts. Government efforts to reduce Medicare and Medicaid
expenses are expected to increase the use of managed care organizations. This
may result in managed care influencing prescription decisions for a larger
segment of the population. International operations are also subject to price
and market regulations. As a result, it is expected that pressures on pricing
and operating results will continue.

CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS
During 1995, the authors of some nonclinical studies questioned the safety of
calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Although the clinical evidence supported the
safety of this class of medications, the FDA convened an advisory panel to
review their safety. In 1996, that advisory panel found no data to support
challenges to the safety of newer sustained-release and intrinsically
long-acting CCBs (such as Norvasc and Procardia XL--products for treatment of
hypertension and angina).


     Questions about this class of products continued throughout 1997, however,
and included scientific publications and presentations asserting that these
products were associated with various serious medical conditions.

     During 1997, data from newly conducted studies and reviews, etc. and
decisions by two national regulatory authorities plus newly published National
Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines were all supportive of the safety of
long-acting CCBs like Norvasc and Procardia XL and that they were appropriate
first-line medications in the treatment of hypertension.

     We continue to believe that the safety and effectiveness of Norvasc and
Procardia XL are supported by a large body of data from numerous studies and the
daily clinical experiences of physicians around the world. It is not possible,
however, to predict the impact on our future sales, if any, of existing or
future studies, regulatory agency actions or a continuing debate regarding CCBs.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek a
reduction in the potential negative earnings effects from changes in foreign
exchange and interest rates arising in our business activities. We manage these
financial exposures through operational means and by using various financial
instruments. These practices may change as economic conditions change.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

A significant portion of our revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in
foreign exchange rates. Where practical, we seek to relate expected local
currency revenues with local currency costs and local currency assets with local
currency liabilities.

     Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency
forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential
earnings effects from short-term foreign currency assets and liabilities that
arise during normal operations.

     In addition, foreign currency put options are purchased to reduce a portion
of the potential negative effects on earnings related to certain of our
significant anticipated intercompany inventory purchases for up to one year.
These purchased options hedge Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.

     Also, under certain market conditions, we protect against possible declines
in the reported net assets of our international subsidiaries in Japan. We do
this through currency swaps and borrowing in Japanese yen.

     Our financial instrument holdings at year-end were analyzed to determine
their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. The fair value of these
instruments was determined as follows:

  o  forward-exchange contracts and currency swaps--net present values

  o  purchased foreign currency options--foreign exchange option pricing model

  o  foreign receivables, payables, debt and loans--changes in exchange rates

     In our sensitivity analysis, we assumed that the change in one currency's
rates relative to the U.S. dollar would not have an effect on other currencies'
rates relative to the U.S. dollar. All other factors were held constant.

     If there were an adverse change in foreign exchange rates of 10%, the
expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be
immaterial. For additional details, see note 5-D, "Derivative Financial
Instruments--Accounting Policies," on page 47.

INTEREST RATE RISK
Our U.S. dollar interest-bearing investments, loans and borrowings are subject
to interest rate risk. We invest and borrow primarily on a short-term or
variable-rate basis. We are also subject to interest rate risk on Japanese yen
short-term borrowings. Under certain market conditions, interest rate swap
contracts are used to adjust interest sensitive assets and liabilities. 

     Our financial instrument holdings at year-end were analyzed to determine
their sensitivity to interest rate changes. The fair values of these instruments
were determined by net present values.

     In our sensitivity analysis, we used the same change in interest rate for
all maturities. All other factors were held constant. If interest rates
increased by 10%, the expected effect on net income related to our financial
instruments would be immaterial.

FOREIGN MARKETS
Thirty-nine percent of our 1998 revenues arise from international operations and
we expect revenue and net income growth in 1999 to be impacted by changes in
foreign exchange rates.

Revenues from Asia comprised approximately 12% of total revenues in 1998,
including 7% from Japan. Revenues from the Asian markets most impacted by recent
economic events--Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Taiwan--comprised approximately 1% of 1998 total revenues. Revenues from Latin
America comprised approximately 5% of total revenues in 1998, including 2% from
Brazil.

EUROPEAN CURRENCY 
A new European currency (Euro) was introduced in January 1999 to replace the
separate currencies of 11 individual countries. This entails changes in our
operations as we modify systems and commercial arrangements to deal with the new
currency. Modifications are necessary in operations such as payroll, benefits
and pension systems, contracts with suppliers and customers and internal
financial reporting systems. Although there is a three-year transition period
during which transactions can be made in the old currencies, this may require
dual currency processes for our operations. We have identified issues involved
and are developing and implementing solutions. The cost of this effort is not
expected to have a material effect on our business or results of operations.
There is no guarantee, however, that all problems have been foreseen and
corrected, or that no material disruption will occur in our business. The
conversion to the Euro may have competitive implications on our pricing and
marketing strategies; however, the full impact is not known at this time.

TAX LEGISLATION
Pursuant to the Small Jobs Protection Act of 1996 (the Act), Section 936 of the
Internal Revenue Code (the U.S. possessions corporation income tax credit) was
repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 1995. The Act allows us to
continue using the credit against the tax arising from manufacturing income
earned in a U.S. possession for an additional 10-year period. The amount of
manufacturing income eligible for the credit during this additional period is
subject to a cap based on income earned prior to 1996 in the U.S. possession.
This 10-year extension period does not apply to investment income earned in a
U.S. possession, the credit on which expired as of July 1, 1996. The Act does
not affect the amendments made to Section 936 by the 1993 Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act, which provided for a five-year phase-down of the U.S.
possession tax credit from 100% to 40%. In addition, the 1996 Act permitted the
extension of the R&D tax credit through June 30, 1998. In 1998, this credit was
again extended to June 30, 1999. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which becomes effective for our financial
statements beginning January 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires a company to
recognize all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in its balance
sheet and measure them at fair value. We do not expect the adoption of this
Statement to have a material impact on our financial statements. 

     The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of
Position (SOP) 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use and SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up
Activities, which are effective for our 1999 financial statements. We do not
expect adoption of these SOPs to have a material impact on our financial
statements.

YEAR 2000 COMPUTER SYSTEMS COMPLIANCE 
Many older computer software programs refer to years in terms of their final two
digits only. Such programs may interpret the year 2000 to mean the year 1900, or
another year instead. If not corrected, those programs could cause date-related
or operational transaction failures. We developed a Compliance Assurance Process
to address the Year 2000 issue in four phases: Inventory, Assessment and
Planning, Implementation and Certification. No significant information
technology projects have been deferred as a result of our efforts on Year 2000.

     The Inventory phase included preliminary problem determination, an
inventory of information technology (IT) and non-IT hardware and software and an
inventory of our key business systems and material vendors and business
processes. Such systems relate to our research and development, production,
distribution, financial, administrative and communication operations. This phase
was substantially completed at the end of 1998.


                                                                              37

<PAGE>



We have requested our critical vendors, major customers, service suppliers,
communication providers, product alliance partners and banks to verify their
Year 2000 readiness and are currently evaluating their responses. This
evaluation is complete for all of our critical trading partners, but continues
for non-critical partners. 

     During our Assessment and Planning phase each inventoried item is assessed
to evaluate its risk, to decide whether to remediate or replace, to identify its
priority and to develop a plan for the system. Systems are prioritized based on
their importance to the business, risk of failure, time horizon to failure and
dependency on other critical items. This phase was 90% complete at December 31,
1998, and will be finished by the end of the first quarter of 1999.

     The plans developed during the Assessment and Planning phase are being
executed in the Implementation phase. Remediation and replacement of non-Year
2000 compliant systems is in process and we expect our critical systems to be
substantially remediated or replaced by March 31, 1999. The remaining systems,
including embedded systems, will be modified by the end of the third quarter of
1999. While our Implementation efforts are approximately 65% complete, this
phase will overlap with the Certification phase. 

     During the Certification phase, we will be testing and certifying the
results of our remediation efforts. Testing begins as systems are remediated and
will continue throughout 1999. Testing attempts are to verify that all of our
systems function correctly and extend to all interfaces with key business
partners. We expect to substantially complete testing of critical systems by
March 31, 1999, and the testing of remaining systems and key third-party systems
by the end of the third quarter of 1999.

     Because the company's Year 2000 compliance is dependent upon key third
parties also being Year 2000 compliant on a timely basis, there can be no
guarantee that the company's efforts will prevent a material adverse impact on
its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. If our systems or
those of key third parties are not fully Year 2000 functional, we estimate that
up to a two-week disruption in operations could occur. Such a disruption could
result in delays in the distribution of finished goods or receipt of raw
materials, errors in customer order taking, disruption of clinical activities or
delays in product development. These consequences could have a material adverse
impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows if we
are unable to substantially conduct our business in the ordinary course. We
believe that our efforts, including the development of a contingency plan, will
significantly reduce the adverse impact that any disruption in business might
have.

     As part of the contingency plan being developed, Business Continuity Plans
(the Plans) will address critical areas of our business. The Plans will be
designed to mitigate serious disruptions to our business flow beyond the end of
1999 and operate independent of our external providers' Year 2000 compliance.
The Plans will likely provide for maintaining increased inventory to meet
customer needs, protecting the integrity of ongoing activities, identifying and
securing alternate sources of critical services, materials and utilities when
possible and establishing crisis teams to address unexpected problems. We expect
to complete the preliminary Plans by the end of the first quarter 1999 and the
final Plans by the end of the second quarter 1999. 

     We estimate that the total cost involved in our Year 2000 program is
approximately $127 million of which $36 million has been incurred to date. Costs
for 1999 are estimated to be approximately $91 million, which reflect changes in
estimates and the inclusion of accelerated replacement costs as a result of a
clarification in disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. These costs are expensed as incurred, except for capitalizable
hardware of $5 million in 1998 and $15 million estimated for 1999 and are being
funded through operating cash flows. Such costs do not include normal system
upgrades and replacements. 

     Both our cost estimates and completion timeframes will be influenced by our
ability to successfully identify Year 2000 problems, the nature and amount of
programming required to fix the programs, the availability and cost of personnel
trained in this area and the Year 2000 compliance success that key third parties
attain. As the development of contingency plans continues, the costs to complete
our Year 2000 program may increase. While these and other unforeseen factors
could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial
condition, we believe that our ongoing efforts to address the Year 2000 issue
will minimize possible negative consequences to our company. 

LITIGATION, TAX AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
Claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries for various legal and
tax matters. In addition, our operations are subject to international, federal,
state and local environmental laws and regulations. It is possible that our cash
flows and results of operations could be affected by the one-time impact of the
resolution of these contingencies. We believe that the ultimate disposition of
these matters to the extent not previously provided for will not have a material
impact on our financial condition or cash flows and results of operations,
except where specifically commented on in note 17, "Litigation," beginning on
page 55 and note 8, "Taxes on Income," beginning on page 50.

RECENT EVENTS 
On January 28, 1999, we announced that, barring unusual circumstances, our Board
of Directors intends to vote on a three-for-one split of our common stock on
April 22, 1999. At the annual meeting to take place on the same date,
shareholders will vote on a proposal to increase the authorized shares of our
common stock.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
We prepared and are responsible for the financial statements that appear on
pages 40 to 61. These financial statements are in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles and, therefore, include amounts based on informed
judgments and estimates. We also accept responsibility for the preparation of
other financial information that is included in this document.

     We have designed a system of internal control to:

  o  safeguard the Company's assets,

  o  ensure that transactions are properly authorized, and

  o  provide reasonable assurance, at reasonable cost, of the integrity,
     objectivity and reliability of the financial information.

     An effective internal control system has inherent limitations, no matter
how well designed and, therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation. The system is built on a business
ethics policy that requires all employees to maintain the highest ethical
standards in conducting Company affairs. Our system of internal control
includes:

  o  careful selection, training and development of financial managers,

  o  an organizational structure that segregates responsibilities,

  o  a communications program which ensures that the Company's policies and
     procedures are well understood throughout the organization and

  o  an extensive program of internal audits, with prompt follow-up, including 
     reviews of separate operations and functions around the world.

     Our independent certified public accountants, KPMG LLP, have audited the
annual financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. The independent auditors' report expresses an informed judgment as to
the fair presentation of the Company's reported operating results, financial
position and cash flows. Their judgment is based on the results of auditing
procedures performed and such other tests that they deemed necessary, including
their consideration of our internal control structure. 

     We consider and take appropriate action on recommendations made by KPMG LLP
and our internal auditors. We believe that our system of internal control is
effective and adequate to accomplish the objectives discussed above.

AUDIT COMMITTEE'S REPORT
The Board of Directors reviews the audit function, the system of internal
control and financial statements largely through its Audit Committee, which
consists solely of directors who are not Company employees. The requirements of
the Audit Committee's charter have been complied with during 1998. The Audit
Committee met six times in 1998 with management, the independent auditors and
internal auditors concerning their respective responsibilities. Among its
various duties, the Audit Committee recommends the appointment of the Company's
independent auditors. Both KPMG LLP and the internal auditors have full access
to the Audit Committee and meet with it, without management present, to discuss
the scope and results of their examinations including internal control, audit
and financial reporting matters.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

(LOGO)

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Pfizer Inc:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Pfizer Inc and
subsidiary companies as of December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pfizer Inc
and subsidiary companies at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A--CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the parent company and all
significant subsidiaries, including those operating outside the U.S. Balance
sheet amounts for the foreign operations are as of November 30 of each year and
income statement amounts are for the full-year periods ending on the same date.
Substantially all unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries are free of
legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions among our
businesses have been eliminated. As discussed in note 2, "Discontinued
Operations," the Valleylab, Schneider, American Medical Systems (AMS), Howmedica
and Strato/Infusaid businesses, which comprised the Medical Technology Group
(MTG), are presented as discontinued operations. We made certain
reclassifications to the 1997 and 1996 financial statements to conform to the
1998 presentation.

     In preparing the financial statements, management must use some estimates
and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. Estimates are
used when accounting for depreciation, amortization, employee benefits and asset
valuation allowances. We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ from estimated results, such as changes in the
health care environment, competition, foreign exchange and legislation.
"Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results,"
beginning on page 35, discusses these and other uncertainties. 

B--CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as demand
deposits, certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of
three months or less when purchased. If items meeting this definition are part
of a larger investment pool, we classify them as SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.

C--INVENTORIES 
We value inventories at cost or fair value, if lower. Cost is determined as
follows:

   o finished goods and work-in-process at average actual cost 

   o raw materials and supplies at average or latest actual cost

     "Last-in, first-out" (LIFO) usage applies to U.S.-sourced pharmaceuticals
and part of animal health inventories (approximately 8% of total inventories)
and "first-in, first-out" usage applies to the rest. The replacement cost of
LIFO inventories is not materially different from the LIFO value reported.

D--LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
Long-lived assets include:

   o property, plant and equipment--These assets are recorded at original cost
     increased by the cost of any significant improvements after purchase. We
     depreciate the cost evenly over the assets' useful lives. For tax purposes,
     accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.

   o goodwill--Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of
     acquired businesses and the fair value of their net assets when accounted
     for by the purchase method of accounting. We amortize goodwill evenly over
     periods not exceeding 40 years.

   o other intangible assets--Other intangible assets are included in OTHER
     ASSETS, DEFERRED TAXES AND DEFERRED CHARGES. We amortize these assets
     evenly over their estimated useful lives.

E--FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
For most foreign operations, local currencies are considered their functional
currencies. We translate assets and liabilities to their U.S. dollar equivalents
at rates in effect at the balance sheet date and record translation adjustments
in SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. We translate Statement of Income accounts at average
rates for the period. Transaction adjustments are recorded in OTHER
DEDUCTIONS--NET.

     For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate the balance
sheet items as follows:

   o monetary items (that is, assets and liabilities that will be settled for
     cash) at rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with translation
     adjustments recorded in OTHER DEDUCTIONS--NET

   o non-monetary items at historical rates (that is, those in effect when the
     items were first recorded) 

F--PRODUCT ALLIANCES 
We have agreements to promote pharmaceutical products developed by other
companies. ALLIANCE REVENUE represents revenues earned under copromotion
agreements (a percentage of net sales adjusted, in some cases, for certain
specific costs). SELLING, INFORMATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES include
other expenses for selling and marketing these products.

     We have license agreements in certain foreign countries for these products.
When products are sold under license agreements, we record NET SALES instead of
ALLIANCE REVENUE and record related costs and expenses in the appropriate
caption in the Statement of Income.

G--STOCK OPTIONS
The exercise price of stock options granted equals the market price on the grant
date. In general, there is no recorded expense related to stock options. Stock
options outstanding are presumed to be exercised for the purposes of computing
diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 

H--ADVERTISING EXPENSE 
We record advertising expense as follows:

   o production costs as incurred

   o costs of radio time, television time and space in publications deferred 
     until the advertising first occurs

     Advertising expense totaled $1,139 million in 1998, $898 million in 1997
and $738 million in 1996.

2 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In 1998, we completed the disposal of the MTG segment. Accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect the results of
operations and net assets of the MTG businesses--Valleylab, Schneider, AMS,
Howmedica and Strato/Infusaid--as discontinued operations. We completed the
sales of:

   o Howmedica to Stryker Corporation in December for $1.65 billion in cash 

   o Schneider to Boston Scientific Corporation in September for $2.1 billion in
     cash

   o AMS to E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co., LLC in September for $130 million
     in cash

   o Valleylab to U.S. Surgical Corporation in January for $425 million
     in cash

     In 1997, we sold Strato/Infusaid to Horizon Medical Products and Arrow
International for $21 million in cash.

     The contractual net assets identified as part of the disposition of
Valleylab, Schneider, AMS, Howmedica and Strato/Infusaid are recorded as NET
ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS and the net cash flows of these businesses are
reported as NET CASH PROVIDED BY DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. NET ASSETS OF
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS consisted of the following:

4 COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Effective January 1, 1998, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (SFAS) No. 130, REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. This Statement 
establishes standards for the reporting of all changes in equity from
nonshareholder sources. Prior year financial statements have been conformed to 
the requirements of SFAS No. 130.


                                                                              45

B--SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
The weighted average effective interest rate on short-term borrowings
outstanding at December 31 was 3.7% in 1998, 2.9% in 1997 and 4.9% in 1996. We
had approximately $1.3 billion available to borrow under lines of credit at
December 31, 1998.

================================================================================

     The floating-rate unsecured notes mature on various dates from 2001 to 2005
and bear interest at a defined variable rate based on the commercial paper
borrowing rate. The weighted average interest rate was 5.3% at December 31,
1998. These notes minimize credit risk on certain available-for-sale debt
securities that may be used to satisfy the notes at maturity. In September 1998,
we repaid $195 million of the outstanding floating-rate unsecured notes prior to
their scheduled maturity by using the proceeds from the issuance of short-term
commercial paper.

D--DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
PURPOSE
"Forward-exchange contracts," "currency swaps" and "purchased currency options"
are used to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks. Also, "interest rate
swap" contracts are used to adjust interest rate exposures. 

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We consider derivative financial instruments to be "hedges" (that is, an offset
of foreign exchange and interest rate risks) when certain criteria are met.
Under hedge accounting for a purchased currency option, its impact on earnings
is deferred until the recognition of the underlying hedged item (inventory) in
earnings. We recognize the earnings impact of the other instruments during the
terms of the contracts, along with the earnings impact of the items they offset.

     Purchased currency options are recorded at cost and amortized evenly to
operations through the expected inventory delivery date. Gains at the
transaction date are included in the cost of the related inventory purchased.

     As interest rates change, we accrue the difference between the debt
interest rates recognized in the Statement of Income and the amounts payable to
or receivable from counterparties under interest rate swap contracts. Likewise,
amounts arising from currency swap contracts are accrued as exchange rates
change.

     The financial statements include the following items related to derivative
and other financial instruments serving as hedges or offsets:

     PREPAID EXPENSES, TAXES AND OTHER ASSETS include:
       o purchased currency options

     OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES include:
       o fair value of forward-exchange contracts
       o net amounts payable related to interest rate swap contracts

     OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES include:
       o net amounts payable related to currency swap contracts

     ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(EXPENSE) include changes in the: 
       o foreign exchange translation of currency swaps and foreign debt 
       o fair value of forward-exchange contracts for net investment hedges

     OTHER DEDUCTIONS--NET include:
       o changes in the fair value of foreign exchange instruments and changes
         in foreign-denominated assets and liabilities 
       o payments under swap contracts to offset, primarily, interest expense 
         or, to a lesser extent, net foreign exchange losses 
       o amortization of discounts or premiums on currencies sold under forward-
         exchange contracts

     Our criteria to qualify for hedge accounting are:

     FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS
       o The instrument must relate to a foreign currency asset, liability or an
         anticipated transaction that is probable and whose characteristics and
         terms have been identified.
       o It must involve the same currency as the hedged item.
       o It must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on our
         operations.

     INTEREST RATE INSTRUMENTS
       o The instrument must relate to an asset or a liability.
       o It must change the character of the interest rate by converting a
         variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.

     The following table summarizes the exposures hedged or offset by the
various instruments we use:

Total interest rate swap contracts           $ 321   $1,219   $1,360
================================================================================

     The Japanese yen for U.S. dollar currency swaps require that we make
interim payments of a fixed rate of 1.1% on the Japanese yen payable and have
interim receipts of a variable rate based on a commercial paper rate on the U.S.
dollar receivable. These currency swaps replaced $625 million of Japanese yen
debt, which previously served as a hedge of our net investments in Japan, as
well as related interest rate swaps.

     The Japanese yen and Swiss franc interest rate swaps effectively fixed the
interest rate on floating rate debt as follows:

     o the Japanese yen debt at 1.4% in 1998 and 1997 and 0.7% in 1996 

     o the Swiss franc debt at 2.1% in 1997 and 1996

     The floating interest rates were based on "LIBOR" rates related to the
contract currencies. In connection with the sale of the Schneider Swiss
subsidiary in 1998, we terminated the Swiss franc interest rate swap contracts
and ceased borrowing Swiss francs. The contracts outstanding at December 31,
1996, matured in December 1997. 

E--FAIR VALUE 
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
derivative and other financial instruments at the balance sheet date:

   o short-term financial instruments (cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
     payable, forward-exchange contracts, short-term investments and
     borrowings)--cost approximates fair value because of the short maturity
     period

   o loans--cost approximates fair value because of the short interest reset
     period

   o long-term investments, long-term debt, forward-exchange contracts and
     purchased currency options--fair value is based on market or dealer quotes

   o interest rate and currency swap agreements--fair value is based on
     estimated cost to terminate the agreements (taking into account broker
     quotes, current interest rates and the counterparties' creditworthiness)

     The differences between fair and carrying values were not material at 
December 31, 1998, 1997 or 1996.

F--CREDIT RISK
We periodically review the creditworthiness of counterparties to foreign
exchange and interest rate agreements and do not expect to incur a loss from
failure of any counterparties to perform under the agreements. In general, there
is no requirement for collateral from customers. There are no significant
concentrations of credit risk related to our financial instruments. No
individual counterparty credit exposure exceeded 10% of our consolidated
SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY at December 31, 1998.

================================================================================
*COS--COST OF SALES; SI&A--SELLING, INFORMATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; 
OD--OTHER DEDUCTIONS-NET.

     In 1998, we recorded an impairment charge of $110 million in the
pharmaceutical segment to adjust intangible asset values, primarily goodwill and
trademarks, related to consumer health care product lines.

     These charges are a result of significant changes in the marketplace and a
revision of our strategies, including:

     o the decision to redeploy resources from personal care and minor brands to
       over-the-counter switches of prescription products 

     o the withdrawal of one of our major over-the-counter products in Italy 

     o an acquired product line which experienced declines in market share

     Our animal health antibiotic feed additive, Stafac, was banned, effective
in mid 1999, throughout the European Union, resulting in asset impairment
charges of $103 million ($85 million was to adjust intangible asset values,
primarily goodwill and trademarks, and $18 million was to adjust the carrying
value of machinery and equipment in the pharmaceutical segment).

     These events have caused the projected undiscounted cash flows of a number
of our consumer health care product lines and Stafac to be less than their
carrying value. As a result, we lowered the carrying value of the
above-mentioned assets to their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value
is the present value of the expected associated cash flows.

     The components of the restructuring charges follow:

     These charges resulted from a current review of our global operations to
increase efficiencies and return on assets, thereby resulting in plant and
product line rationalizations. In addition to the disposition of our MTG
businesses, we have exited, or plan to exit by the end of 1999, certain product
lines including those associated with certain of our livestock external
parasiticides and feed businesses. Also, we have decided to exit certain of our
fermentation operations.

     We have written off assets related to the product lines we are exiting,
including inventory, intangible assets--primarily goodwill--as well as certain
buildings, machinery and equipment for which we have no plans to use or sell. We
have begun to seek buyers for other properties which have been written down to
their estimated fair value. We will either dispose of or abandon these
properties by the end of 1999.

                                                                              49

     As a result of the restructuring, the work force will be reduced by 520
manufacturing, sales and corporate personnel. Notifications to personnel have
been made. At December 31, 1998, 134 employees had been terminated. We will
complete terminations of the remaining personnel by December 31, 1999. Employee
termination costs represent payments for severance, outplacement counseling
fees, medical and other benefits and a $5 million noncash charge for the
acceleration of nonvested employee stock options.

     Other restructuring charges consist of charges for inventory for product
lines we have exited--$12 million, contract termination payments--$9 million,
facility closure costs--$7 million and environmental remediation costs
associated with the disposal of certain facilities--$16 million.

  Amounts are reflected in the preceding tables based on the location of the
taxing authorities. As of December 31, 1998, we have not made a U.S. tax
provision for approximately $1.5 billion on approximately $6.5 billion of
unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. These earnings are
expected, for the most part, to be reinvested overseas.

     We operate a manufacturing subsidiary in Puerto Rico that benefits from a
Puerto Rican incentive grant in effect through the end of 2002. Under this
grant, we are partially exempt from income, property and municipal taxes. For
further information on U.S.taxation of Puerto Rican operations, see "Tax 
Legislation" on page 37.

     Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between financial
statement accounting and tax accounting, known as "temporary differences." We
record the tax effect of these temporary differences as "deferred tax assets"
(generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future
periods) and "deferred tax liabilities" (generally items that we received a tax
deduction for, but have not yet been recorded in the Statement of Income).

     A valuation allowance is recorded because some items recorded as foreign
deferred tax assets may not be deductible or creditable. The "foreign tax credit
carryforwards" were generated from dividends paid by subsidiaries to the parent
company between 1993 and 1998. We can carry these credits forward to various
dates through 2003 and use them in payment of certain U.S. tax liabilities.

     The Internal Revenue Service has completed its audits of our tax returns
through 1992.

     In November 1994, Belgian tax authorities notified Pfizer Research and
Development Company N.V./S.A. (PRDCO), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
our company, of a proposed adjustment to the taxable income of PRDCO for fiscal
year 1992. The proposed adjustment arises from an assertion by the Belgian tax
authorities of jurisdiction with respect to income resulting primarily from
certain transfers of property by our non-Belgian subsidiaries to the Irish
branch of PRDCO. In January 1995, PRDCO received an assessment from the tax
authorities for additional taxes and interest of approximately $432 million and
$97 million, respectively, relating to these matters. In January 1996, PRDCO
received an assessment from the tax authorities, for fiscal year 1993, for
additional taxes and interest of approximately $86 million and $18 million,
respectively. The additional assessment arises from the same assertion by the
Belgian tax authorities of jurisdiction with respect to all income of the Irish
branch of PRDCO. Based upon the relevant facts regarding the Irish branch of
PRDCO and the provisions of the Belgian tax laws and the written opinions of
outside counsel, we believe that the assessments are without merit.
     We believe that our accrued tax liabilities are adequate for all years.

9 PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Effective January 1, 1998, we adopted SFAS No. 132, EMPLOYERS' DISCLOSURES ABOUT
PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. SFAS No. 132 requires revised 
disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

     Our pension plans cover most employees worldwide. Our postretirement plans
in the U.S. provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees and their
eligible dependents.

     The net pension assets belonging to AMS and certain Howmedica employees
were transferred to the buyers at the date of sale. We retained the accumulated
benefit obligation related to Valleylab, Schneider and certain Howmedica
employees.

     An average increase of 7.5% in the cost of health care benefits was assumed
for 1999 and is projected to decrease to 5.2% after six years and to then remain
at that level.

     A 1% change in the medical trend rate assumed for postretirement benefits
would have the following effects at December 31, 1998:

10 SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLANS
We have savings and investment plans for most employees in the U.S., Puerto
Rico, the U.K. and Ireland. Employees may contribute a portion of their salaries
to the plans and we match a portion of the employee contributions. Our
contributions were $48 million in 1998, $43 million in 1997 and $36 million in
1996.

11 LEASE COMMITMENTS
We lease properties for use in our operations. In addition to rent, the leases
require us to pay directly for taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating
expenses, or to pay higher rent when operating expenses increase. Rental
expense, net of sublease income, was $131 million in 1998, $127 million in 1997
and $110 million in 1996. This table shows future minimum rental commitments
under noncancellable leases at December 31, 1998:

12 COMMON STOCK
We effected a two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a 100% stock
dividend in 1997. The split followed a vote by shareholders to increase the
number of authorized common shares. All share and per share information in this
report reflects the split.

     In September 1998, we completed a program under which we purchased 26.4
million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $2 billion. In that same
month, the Board of Directors approved a new share-purchase program with
authorization to purchase up to $5 billion of our company's common stock. In
1998, we purchased approximately 19.3 million shares of our common stock at an
average price of $99 per share under these share-purchase programs. Of the 19.3
million shares repurchased in 1998, 4.9 million shares were repurchased under
the share-purchase program which started in September 1998, for a total cost of
$525 million.

13 PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS
Preferred Stock Purchase Rights have a scheduled term through October 2007,
although the term may be extended or the Rights may be redeemed prior to
expiration. One right was issued for each share of common stock issued by our
company. These rights are not exercisable unless certain change-in-control
events transpire, such as a person acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock or an
announcement of a tender offer for at least 30% of our stock. The rights are
evidenced by corresponding common stock certificates and automatically trade
with the common stock unless an event transpires that makes them exercisable. If
the rights become exercisable, separate certificates evidencing the rights will
be distributed and each right will entitle the holder to purchase a new series
of preferred stock at a defined price from our company. The preferred stock, in
addition to preferred dividend and liquidation rights, will entitle the holder
to vote with the company's common stock.

     The rights are redeemable by us at a fixed price until 10 days, or longer
as determined by the Board, after certain defined events, or at any time prior
to the expiration of the rights.

     We have reserved 3.0 million preferred shares to be issued pursuant to
these rights. No such shares have yet been issued. At the present time, the
rights have no dilutive effect on the earnings per common share calculation.

14 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUSTS
In 1993, we sold 40 million shares of treasury stock to the Pfizer Inc. Grantor
Trust in exchange for a $600 million note. The Trust is used primarily to fund
our benefit plans including the stock option plan. The Balance Sheet reflects
the fair value of shares owned by the Trust as a reduction of SHAREHOLDERS'
EQUITY, representing unearned benefit costs. This amount is reduced as benefits
are satisfied.

     We record compensation expense for the benefit plans, other than stock
options, based on the fair value of the shares when released.

15 STOCK OPTION AND PERFORMANCE AWARDS
We may grant stock options to any employee, including officers, under our Stock
and Incentive Plan. Options are exercisable after five years or less, subject to
continuous employment and certain other conditions and expire 10 years after the
grant date. Once exercisable, the employee can purchase shares of our common
stock at the market price on the date we granted the option.

     The Plan also allows for stock appreciation rights, stock awards and
performance awards. In 1996, shareholders approved amendments to increase the
shares available in the Plan and to extend its term through 2005.


                                                                              53

     These figures reflect only the impact of grants since January 1, 1995, and
reflect only part of the possible compensation expense that we would amortize
over the vesting period of the grants (up to five years). In future years,
therefore, the effect on net income and earnings per common share may differ
from those shown above.

     The Performance-Contingent Share Award Program was established effective in
1993 to provide executives and other key employees the right to earn common
stock awards. We determine the award payouts after the performance period ends,
based on specific performance criteria. Under the Program, up to 40 million
shares may be awarded. We awarded approximately 653,000 shares in 1998,
approximately 449,000 shares in 1997 and approximately 320,000 shares in 1996.
At December 31, 1998, program participants had the right to earn up to 5.1
million additional shares. Compensation expense related to the Program was $202
million in 1998, $74 million in 1997 and $31 million in 1996.

     In 1998, we entered into two forward-purchase contracts for 1 million
shares of our common stock for $101 million to offset the potential impact on
income of our liability under the Program. These contracts mature within one
year. At settlement date we will, at the option of the counterparty to the
contract, either receive our own stock or settle the contracts for cash.
     The financial statements include the following items related to these
contracts:

16 INSURANCE
We maintain insurance coverage adequate for our needs. Under our insurance
contracts, we usually accept self-insured retentions appropriate for our
specific business risks.

17 LITIGATION
The Company is involved in a number of claims and litigations, including product
liability claims and litigations considered normal in the nature of its
businesses. These include suits involving various pharmaceutical and hospital
products that allege either reaction to or injury from use of the product. In
addition, from time to time the Company is involved in, or is the subject of,
various governmental or agency inquiries or investigations relating to its
businesses.

     On June 9, 1997, the Company received notice of the filing of an
Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) by Mylan Pharmaceuticals for a
sustained-release nifedipine product asserted to be bioequivalent to Procardia
XL. Mylan's notice asserted that the proposed formulation does not infringe
relevant licensed Alza and Bayer patents and thus that approval of their ANDA
should be granted before patent expiration. On July 18, 1997, the Company,
together with Bayer AG and Bayer Corporation, filed a patent-infringement suit
against Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Laboratories Inc. in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania with respect to
Mylan's ANDA. Suit was filed under Bayer AG's U.S. Patent No. 5,264,446,
licensed to the Company, relating to nifedipine of a specified particle size
range. Mylan has filed its answer denying infringement and a scheduling order
has been entered. Final discovery has been extended to May 3, 1999, with
disposition motions to be filed by May 21, 1999. On or about February 23, 1998,
Bayer AG received notice that Biovail Laboratories Incorporated had filed an
ANDA for a sustained-release nifedipine product asserted to be bioequivalent to
one dosage strength (60 mg.) of Procardia XL. The notice was subsequently
received by the Company as well. The notice asserts that the Biovail product
does not infringe Bayer's U.S. Patent No. 5,264,446. On March 26, 1998, the
Company received notice of the filing of an ANDA by Biovail Laboratory of a 30
mg. dosage formulation of nifedipine alleged to be bioequivalent to Procardia
XL. On April 2, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer filed a patent-infringement action
against Biovail, relating to their 60 mg. nifedipine product, in the United
States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. On May 6, 1998, Bayer and
Pfizer filed a second patent infringement action in Puerto Rico against Biovail
under the same patent with respect to Biovail's 30 mg. nifedipine product. These
actions have been consolidated for discovery and trial. On April 24, 1998,
Biovail Laboratories Inc. brought suit in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Pennsylvania against the Company and Bayer seeking a
declaratory judgment of invalidity of and/or non-infringement of the 5,264,446
nifedipine patent as well as a finding of violation of the antitrust laws.
Biovail has also moved to transfer the patent infringement actions from Puerto
Rico to the Western District of Pennsylvania. Pfizer has opposed this motion to
transfer and on June 19, 1998, moved to dismiss Biovail's declaratory judgment
action and antitrust action in the Western District of Pennsylvania, or in the
alternative to stay the action pending the outcome of the infringement actions
in Puerto Rico. On January 4, 1999, the District Court in Pennsylvania granted
Pfizer's motion for a stay of the antitrust action pending the outcome of the
infringement actions in Puerto Rico. On January 29, 1999, the District Court in
Puerto Rico denied Biovail's motion to transfer the patent infringement actions
from Puerto Rico to the Western District of Pennsylvania.

     On April 2, 1998, the Company received notice from Lek U.S.A. Inc. of its
filing of an ANDA for a 60 mg. formulation of nifedipine alleged to be
bioequivalent to Procardia XL. On May 14, 1998, Bayer and Pfizer commenced suit
against Lek for infringement of Bayer's U.S. Patent No. 5,264,446, as well as
for infringement of a second Bayer patent, No. 4,412,986 relating to
combinations of nifedipine with certain polymeric materials. On September 14,
1998, Lek was served with the summons and complaint. Plaintiffs amended the
complaint on November 10, 1998, limiting the action to infringement of U.S.
Patent 4,412,986. On January 19, 1999, Lek filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint alleging infringement of U.S. Patent 4,412,986. Pfizer's response to
this motion is due on February 25, 1999.

     On November 9, 1998, Pfizer received an ANDA notice letter from Martec
Pharmaceutical, Inc. for generic versions (30 mg., 60 mg., 90 mg.) of Procardia
XL. On or about December 18, 1998, Pfizer received a new ANDA certification
letter stating that the ANDA had actually been filed in the name of Martec
Scientific, Inc. On December 23, 1998, Pfizer brought an action against Martec
Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Martec Scientific, Inc. in the Western District of
Missouri for infringement of Bayer's patent relating to nifedipine of a specific
particle size. On January 26, 1999, a second complaint was filed against Martec
Scientific in the Western District of Missouri based on Martec's new ANDA
certification letter. 

     Pfizer filed suit on july 8, 1997, against the FDA in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking a declaratory judgment and
injunctive relief enjoining the FDA from processing Mylan's ANDA or any other
ANDA submission referencing Procardia XL that uses a different extended-release
mechanism. Pfizer's suit alleges that extended-release mechanisms that are not
identical to 


                                                                              55

the osmotic pump mechanism of Procardia XL constitute different dosage forms
requiring the filing and approval of suitability petitions under the Food Drug
and Cosmetics Act before the FDA can accept an ANDA for filing. Mylan intervened
in Pfizer's suit. On March 31, 1998, the U.S. district judge granted the
government's motion for summary judgment against the company. Pfizer has
appealed that decision to the D.C. Court of Appeals and arguments in the case
were heard on February 1, 1999. We are awaiting the decision.
     
     As previously disclosed, a number of lawsuits and claims have been brought
against the Company and Shiley Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary, alleging
either personal injury from fracture of 60(degree) or 70(degree) Shiley Convexo
Concave ("C/C") heart valves, or anxiety that properly functioning implanted
valves might fracture in the future, or personal injury from a prophylactic
replacement of a functioning valve.

     In an attempt to resolve all claims alleging anxiety that properly
functioning valves might fracture in the future, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement in January 1992 in Bowling v. Shiley, et al., a case
brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio,
that established a worldwide settlement class of people with C/C heart valves
and their spouses, except those who elected to exclude themselves. The
settlement provided for a Consultation Fund of $90 million, which was fixed by
the number of claims filed, from which valve recipients received payments that
are intended to cover their cost of consultation with cardiologists or other
health care providers with respect to their valves. The settlement agreement
established a second fund of at least $75 million to support C/C valve-related
research, including the development of techniques to identify valve recipients
who may have significant risk of fracture, and to cover the unreimbursed medical
expenses that valve recipients may incur for certain procedures related to the
valves. The Company's obligation as to coverage of these unreimbursed medical
expenses is not subject to any dollar limitation. Following a hearing on the
fairness of the settlement, it was approved by the court on August 19, 1992, and
all appeals have been exhausted

     Generally, the plaintiffs in all of the pending heart valve litigations
seek money damages. Based on the experience of the Company in defending these
claims to date, including insurance proceeds and reserves, the Company is of the
opinion that these actions should not have a material adverse effect on the
financial position or the results of operations of the Company. Litigation
involving insurance coverage for the Company's heart valve liabilities has been
resolved.

     The Company's operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign
environmental laws and regulations. Under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA" or
"Superfund"), the Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with respect to certain
waste sites with which the Company may have had direct or indirect involvement.
Similar designations have been made by some state environmental agencies under
applicable state superfund laws. Such designations are made regardless of the
extent of the Company's involvement. There are also claims that the Company may
be a responsible party or participant with respect to several waste site matters
in foreign jurisdictions. Such claims have been made by the filing of a
complaint, the issuance of an administrative directive or order, or the issuance
of a notice or demand letter. These claims are in various stages of
administrative or judicial proceedings. They include demands for recovery of
past governmental costs and for future investigative or remedial actions. In
many cases, the dollar amount of the claim is not specified. In most cases,
claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same
recovery or other relief as was asserted against the Company. The Company is
currently participating in remedial action at a number of sites under federal,
state, local and foreign laws.

     To the extent possible with the limited amount of information available at
this time, the Company has evaluated its responsibility for costs and related
liability with respect to the above sites and is of the opinion that the
Company's liability with respect to these sites should not have a material
adverse effect on the financial position or the results of operations of the
Company. In arriving at this conclusion, the Company has considered, among other
things, the payments that have been made with respect to the sites in the past;
the factors, such as volume and relative toxicity, ordinarily applied to
allocate defense and remedial costs at such sites; the probable costs to be paid
by the other potentially responsible parties; total projected remedial costs for
a site, if known; existing technology; and the currently enacted laws and
regulations. The Company anticipates that a portion of these costs and related
liability will be covered by available insurance.

     The Company has entered into a consent decree, subject to court approval,
settling all matters with the United States Environmental Protection
Agency--Region I and the Department of Justice arising primarily out of a
December 1993 multimedia environmental inspection, as well as certain state
inspections, of the Company's Groton, Connecticut facility. The settlement
provides for the payment of $625,000 in fines, undertaking of an environmental
project at a cost of $150,000 and certain other operational provisions, the
implementation of which will not have a material adverse effect on the
operations of the Company.

     Through the early 1970s, Pfizer Inc. (Minerals Division) and Quigley
Company, Inc. ("Quigley"), a wholly owned subsidiary, sold a minimal amount of
one construction product and several refractory products containing some
asbestos. These sales were discontinued thereafter. Although these sales
represented a minor market share, the Company has been named as one of a number
of defendants in numerous lawsuits. These actions, and actions related to the
Company's sale of talc products in the past, claim personal injury resulting
from exposure to asbestos-containing products, and nearly all seek general and
punitive damages. In these actions, the Company or Quigley is typically one of a
number of defendants, and both are members of the Center for Claims Resolution
(the "CCR"), a joint defense organization of twenty defendants that is defending
these claims. The Company and Quigley are responsible for varying percentages of
defense and liability payments for all members of the CCR. A number of cases
alleging property damage from asbestos-containing products installed in
buildings have also been brought against the Company, but most have been
resolved.

     On January 15, 1993, a class action complaint and settlement agreement were
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania involving all personal injury claims by persons who have been
exposed to asbestos-containing products but who have not yet filed a personal
injury action against the members of the CCR (Future Claims Settlement). The
District Court determined that the Future Claims Settlement was fair and
reasonable. Subsequently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit reversed the order of the District Court and on June 27, 1997, the U.S.
Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit's order and decertified the class. The
overturning of the settlement is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company's exposure or on the availability of insurance for the vast majority of
such cases. It is expected, too, that the CCR will attempt to resolve cases in
the same manner as heretofore.

     At approximately the time it filed the Future Claims Settlement class
action, the CCR settled approximately 16,360 personal injury cases on behalf of
its members, including the Company and Quigley. The CCR has continued to settle
remaining and opt-out cases and claims on a similar basis to past settlements.
As of December 28, 1998, there were 57,819 personal injury claims pending
against Quigley (excluding those which are inactive or have been settled in
principle), 33,185 such claims against the Company, and 68 talc cases against
the Company.

     The Company believes that its costs incurred in defending and ultimately
disposing of the asbestos personal injury claims, as well as the property damage
and talc claims, will be largely covered by insurance policies issued by several
primary insurance carriers and a number of excess carriers that have agreed to
provide coverage, subject to deductibles, exclusions, retentions and policy
limits. Litigation is pending against several excess insurance carriers seeking
damages and/or declaratory relief to secure their coverage obligations. Based on
the Company's experience in defending the claims to date and the amount of
insurance coverage available, the Company is of the opinion that the actions
should not ultimately have a material adverse effect on the financial position
or the results of operations of the Company.

     The Company was named, together with numerous other manufacturers of
brand-name prescription drugs and certain companies that distribute brand-name
prescription drugs, in suits in federal and state courts brought by various
groups of retail pharmacy companies. The federal cases consist principally of a
class action by retail pharmacies (including approximately 30 named plaintiffs)
(the "Federal Class Action"), as well as additional actions by approximately
3,500 individual retail pharmacies and a group of chain and supermarket
pharmacies (the "individual actions"). These cases, which were transferred to
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and
coordinated for pretrial purposes, allege that the defendant drug manufacturers
violated the Sherman Act by unlawfully agreeing with each other (and, as alleged
in some cases, with wholesalers) not to extend to retail pharmacy companies the
same discounts allegedly extended to mail order pharmacies, managed care
companies and certain other customers, and by unlawfully discriminating against
retail pharmacy companies by not extending them such discounts. On November 15,
1994, the federal court certified a class (the Federal Class Action) consisting
of all persons or entities who, since October 15, 1989, bought brand-name
prescription drugs from any manufacturer or wholesaler defendant, but
specifically excluding government entities, mail order pharmacies, HMOs,
hospitals, clinics and nursing homes. Fifteen manufacturer defendants, including
the Company, agreed to settle the Federal Class Action subject to court
approval. The Company's share pursuant to an Agreement as of January 31, 1996,
was $31.25 million, payable in four annual installments without interest. The
Company continues to believe that there was no conspiracy and specifically
denied liability in the Settlement Agreement, but had agreed to settle to avoid
the monetary and other costs of litigation. The settlement was filed with the
Court on February 9, 1996 and went through preliminary and final fairness
hearings. By orders of April 4, 1996, the Court: (1) rejected the settlement;
(2) denied the motions of the manufacturers (including the Company) for summary
judgment; (3) granted 



                                                                              57

<PAGE>

the motions of the wholesalers for summary judgment; and (4) denied the motion
to exclude purchases by other than direct purchasers. On August 15, 1997, the
Court of Appeals (1) reversed the denial of summary judgment for the
manufacturers excluding purchases by other than direct purchasers; (2) reversed
the grant of summary judgment dismissing the wholesalers; and (3) took action
regarding Alabama state cases, and DuPont-Merck. In May 1996, thirteen
manufacturer defendants, including the Company, entered into an Amendment to the
Settlement Agreement which was filed with the Court on May 6, 1996. The
Company's financial obligations under the Settlement Agreement were not
increased. The Settlement Agreement, as amended, received final approval on June
21, 1996. Appeals from this decision were dismissed by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit in May 1997. Trial began in September 1998 for the class
case against the non-settlers, and the District Court also permitted the opt-out
plaintiffs to add the wholesalers as named defendants in their cases. The
District Court dismissed the case at the close of the plaintiffs' evidence. The
plaintiffs have appealed.

     Retail pharmacy cases have also been filed in state courts in Alabama,
California, Minnesota, Mississippi and Wisconsin. Pharmacy classes have been
certified in California. The Company's motion to dismiss was granted in the
Wisconsin case, and that dismissal is under appeal.

     Consumer class actions have been filed in Alabama, Arizona, California, the
District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York,
North Carolina, Tennessee, Washington and Wisconsin alleging injury to consumers
from the failure to give discounts to retail pharmacy companies. The New York
and Washington state cases were dismissed, and an appeal is pending in New York.
A case filed in Colorado state court was dismissed without appeal. A consumer
class has been certified in California, and a limited consumer class has been
certified in the District of Columbia. Class certification was denied in the
Michigan state case, and plaintiffs' subsequent petition for review was denied.
Class certification also was denied in the Maine case.

     In addition to its settlement of the retailer Federal Class Action (see
above), the Company has also settled several major opt-out retail cases, and
along with other manufacturers: (1) has entered into an agreement to settle all
outstanding consumer class actions (except Alabama and California), which
settlement is going through the approval process in the various courts in which
the actions are pending; and (2) has entered into an agreement to settle the
California consumer case.

     The Company believes that these brand-name prescription drug antitrust
cases, which generally seek damages and certain injunctive relief, are without
merit.

     The Federal Trade Commission is conducting an investigation focusing on the
pricing practices at issue in the above pharmacy antitrust litigation. In July
1996, the Commission issued a subpoena for documents to the Company, among
others, to which the Company has responded. A second subpoena was issued to the
Company for documents in May 1997 and the Company has responded. This
investigation continues.

     FDA administrative proceedings relating to Plax are pending, principally an
industry-wide call for data on all anti-plaque products by the FDA. The call for
data notice specified that products that have been marketed for a material time
and to a material extent may remain on the market pending FDA review of the
data, provided the manufacturer has a good faith belief that the product is
generally recognized as safe and effective and is not misbranded. The Company
believes that Plax satisfied these requirements and prepared a response to the
FDA's request, which was filed on June 17, 1991. This filing, as well as the
filings of other manufacturers, is still under review and is currently being
considered by an FDA Advisory Committee. The Committee has issued a draft report
recommending that plaque removal claims should not be permitted in the absence
of data establishing efficacy against gingivitis. The process of incorporating
the Advisory Committee recommendations into a final monograph is expected to
take several years. If the draft recommendation is ultimately accepted in the
final monograph, although it would have a negative impact on sales of Plax, it
will not have a material adverse effect on the sales, financial position or
operations of the Company.

     On January 15, 1997, an action was filed in Circuit Court, Chambers County,
Alabama, purportedly on behalf of a class of consumers, variously defined by the
laws or types of laws governing their rights and encompassing residents of up to
47 states. The complaint alleges that the Company's claims for Plax were untrue,
entitling them to a refund of their purchase price for purchases since 1988. A
hearing on Plaintiffs' motion to certify the class was held on June 2, 1998. We
are awaiting the Court's decision. The Company believes the complaint is without
merit.

     The Federal Trade Commission conducted an investigation of the advertising
of Rid, which was resolved by a Consent Decree made final in December, 1998. At
the same time, the New York State Attorney General's office is investigating the
same or similar matters.

     Since December 1998, three actions have been filed, in state courts in
Houston, San Francisco, and Chicago, purportedly on behalf of statewide
(California) or nationwide (Houston) classes of consumers who allege that the
Company's and other manufacturers' advertising and promotional claims for Rid
and other pediculicides were untrue, entitling them to refunds, other damages
and/or injunctive relief. The Houston case has been removed to federal court; no
proceedings have yet occurred in the other cases. The Company believes the
complaints are without merit.

     In April 1996, the Company received a Warning Letter from the FDA relating
to the timeliness and completeness of required post-marketing reports for
pharmaceutical products. The letter did not raise any safety issue about Pfizer
drugs. The Company has been implementing remedial actions designed to remedy the
issues raised in the letter. During 1997, the Company met with the FDA to
apprise them of the scope and status of these activities. A full examination of
the progress made by the Company in this area will occur in 1999.

     During 1998, the Company completed the sale of all of the businesses and
companies that were part of the Medical Technology Group. As part of the sale
provisions, the Company has retained responsibility for certain items, including
matters related to the sale of MTG products sold by the Company before the sale
of the MTG businesses. A number of cases have been brought against Howmedica
Inc. (some of which also name the Company) alleging that P.C.A. one-piece
acetabular hip prostheses sold from 1983 through 1990 were defectively designed
and manufactured and pose undisclosed risks to implantees. The Company believes
that most if not all of these cases are without merit. Between 1994 and 1996,
seven class actions alleging various injuries arising from implantable penile
prostheses manufactured by American Medical Systems were filed and ultimately
dismissed or discontinued. Thereafter, between late 1996 and early 1998,
approximately 700 former members of one or more of the purported classes,
represented by some of the same lawyers who filed the class actions, filed
individual suits in Circuit Court in Minneapolis alleging damages from their use
of implantable penile prostheses. The Company believes that most if not all of
these cases are without merit.

     In June 1993, the Ministry of Justice of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil,
commenced a civil public action against the Company's Brazilian subsidiary,
Laboratorios Pfizer Ltda. ("Pfizer Brazil") asserting that during a period in
1991, Pfizer Brazil withheld sale of the pharmaceutical product Diabinese in
violation of antitrust and consumer protection laws. The action seeks the award
of moral, economic and personal damages to individuals and the payment to a
public reserve fund. On February 8, 1996, the trial court issued a decision
holding Pfizer Brazil liable. The award of damages to individuals and the
payment into the public reserve fund will be determined in a subsequent phase of
the proceedings. The trial court's opinion sets out a formula for calculating
the payment into the public reserve fund which could result in a sum of
approximately $88 million. The total amount of damages payable to eligible
individuals under the decision would depend on the number of persons eventually
making claims. Pfizer Brazil is appealing this decision. The Company believes
that this action is without merit and should not have a material adverse effect
on the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.

                                                                              59

18 SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
As a result of adopting SFAS No. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN
ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION, we split the previously reported Health Care
unit into two segments, pharmaceutical and MTG and combined consumer health care
with pharmaceutical. We operate in the following two business segments:
     o pharmaceutical--including treatments for heart diseases, infectious 
       diseases, central nervous system disorders, diabetes, arthritis, erectile
       dysfunction and allergies, as well as self-medications 
     o animal health--products for food animals and companion animals, including
       antibiotics and feed supplements, vaccines and other veterinary items

     Each separately managed segment offers different products requiring
different marketing and distribution strategies.

     We sell our products primarily to customers in the wholesale sector. In
1998, sales to our three largest wholesalers accounted for 14%, 12% and 10% of
total revenues. These sales were concentrated in the pharmaceutical segment.

     Revenues were in excess of $100 million in each of 12 countries outside the
U.S. in 1998. The U.S. was the only country to contribute more than 10% to total
revenues. The following tables present segment and geographic information:
