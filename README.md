# Financial Services Innovation Lab Project

For this 10-K analyzer project, I used a two layered approach.

I used Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Flask, and the Google Gemini LLM API for the backend to analyze the 10-K documents. I used HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and ChartJS for the front end to display the data.

Back End Tech Stack:

Python: I am very familiar with the language and it has many modules I knew I needed for the project, such as BeautifulSoup and Pandas

BeautifulSoup: In order to parse the 10-K documents, I used BeautifulSoup as I had previously used it in a project to parse HTML, and the 10-K documents were of a similar form. I was able to find the financial data of Pfizer and Zoom using BeautifulSoup to serach for tables within the HTML that cointained key information that I extracted to be cleaned.

Pandas: I used Pandas to store the financial information of Pfizer and Zoom as it is very easy to HTML table into a Pandas data frame. Cleaning data within a Pandas data frame is also very simple.

Flask: I used Flask as I am familiar with it as I have used it before to deploy web apps.

Google Gemini LLM API: I used the Google Gemini Pro LLM to generate an analysis of the two companies as it was free and generated a detailed response.

Front End Tech Stack:

HTML/CSS: I used HTML/CSS to format the web app

JavaScript: I used JavaScript to script pageflow within the web app.

ChartJS: I used ChartJS to create the data visualization as it is a very simple JavaScript library that allowed me to create charts of Pfizer's and Zoom's revenue/net income per year and add it to the web app.

I chose to focus on the insight of how the COVID-19 pandemic affected Zoom and Pfizer as analyzing how companies react to major events can help inform stockholders and investors on the reliability of a company. For example, if another pandemic or similar event occurs in the future, then knowing how comapnies reacted to the last pandemic will be very useful for users to be able to predict which companies will do well.
